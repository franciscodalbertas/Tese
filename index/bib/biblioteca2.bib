	abstract = {Coffee with diverse shade trees is recognized as conserving greater biodiversity than more intensive production methods. Sustainable certification has been proposed as an incentive to conserve shade grown coffee. With 40\% of global coffee production certified as sustainable, evidence is needed to demonstrate whether certification supports the environmental benefits of shade coffee. Environmental and economic data were taken from 278 coffee farms in Nicaragua divided between non-certified and five different sustainable certifications. Farms were propensity-score matched by altitude, area of coffee and farmer education to ensure comparability between non-certified and certified farms. Farms under all certifications had better environmental characteristics than non-certified for some indicators, but none were better for all indicators. Certified farms generally received better prices than non-certified farms. Farms with different certifications had different investment strategies; C.A.F.E. Practice farms had high investment and high return strategies, while Utz and Organic farms had low investment, low productivity strategies. Tree diversity was inversely related to productivity, price and net revenue in general, but not for certified farms that received higher prices. Certification differentiates farms with better environmental characteristics and management, provides some economic benefits to most farmers, and may contribute to mitigating environment/economic trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Coffee agroecosystems are critical to the success of conservation efforts in Latin America because of their ecological and economic importance. Coffee certification programs may offer one way to protect biodiversity and maintain farmer livelihoods. Established coffee certification programs fall into three distinct, but not mutually exclusive categories: organic, fair trade, and shade. The results of previous studies demonstrate that shade certification can benefit biodiversity, but it remains unclear whether a farmer's participation in any certification program can provide both ecological and economic benefits. To assess the value of coffee certification for conservation efforts in the region, we examined economic and ecological aspects of coffee production for eight coffee cooperatives in Chiapas, Mexico, that were certified organic, certified organic and fair trade, or uncertified. We compared vegetation and ant and bird diversity in coffee farms and forests, and interviewed farmers to determine coffee yield, gross revenue from coffee production, and area in coffee production. Although there are no shade-certified farms in the study region, we used vegetation data to determine whether cooperatives would qualify for shade certification. We found no differences in vegetation characteristics, ant or bird species richness, or fraction of forest fauna in farms based on certification. Farmers with organic and organic and fair-trade certification had more land under cultivation and in some cases higher revenue than uncertified farmers. Coffee production area did not vary among farm types. No cooperative passed shade-coffee certification standards because the plantations lacked vertical stratification, yet vegetation variables for shade certification significantly correlated with ant and bird diversity. Although farmers in the Chiapas highlands with organic and/or fair-trade certification may reap some economic benefits from their certification status, their farms may not protect as much biodiversity as shade-certified farms. Working toward triple certification (organic, fair trade, and shade) at the farm level may enhance biodiversity protection, increase benefits to farmers, and lead to more successful conservation strategies in coffee-growing regions.},

	abstract = {The long-standing debate on the relationship between farm size and productivity has been generally limited by the range of farm sizes evaluated and the definition of productivity. In this paper we use data from three Brazilian agricultural censuses to address these issues. In particular, we introduce a wider distribution of farm sizes than presently available from the literature and we employ total factor productivity (TFP) as our performance measure. In doing so, we test which farm size class had the highest TFP levels in 1985 and 2006, how factor productivity growth varied within and across farm size classes between those years, and which policy or factor had the greatest productivity enhancing effect. When examining TFP growth, we move beyond the common decomposition into technical and efficiency changes by identifying the complete distribution of farm productivity performances. We find that by 2006 a U-shaped distribution of productivity over farm sizes had emerged. Considerable 1985–2006 TFP growth differences are prevalent; positive rates for the majority accompany stagnant or negative rates for some. Public education investments were associated with faster productivity growth regardless of farm size, while technical assistance’s positive effect and credit’s negative effect were associated with larger farm sizes. The role of specialization varied by size.},

We study the period 1976–2005. The analysis is based on duality applied to the production theory. The output supplies and conditioned input demands are estimated from a translog multi-output, multi-input restricted profit function, where the total production credit is used as proxy of the total expenditure. Farmer expectations with respect to crop prices are incorporated to the estimation based on the quasi-rational expectation model. The output and input responses to the total expenditure are positive and statistically significant except for cotton, wheat, fertilizer, and pesticides. The short-run output supply response to own prices is inelastic, except for wheat, which presents elastic response to its price. Acreage has a positive impact on the output supply and it is influenced by land productivity. The main conclusion is that farmers face budget restrictions to purchase inputs, and a government credit program might increase the agricultural supply.},

The results show that Pronaf maintains a concentration of resources and contracts on more capitalized farmers, commodity producers (mainly corn, soybeans and coffee) located in the South, Southeast and Center-West in Brazil, reinforcing its strong productivity-based bias. However, on the other hand, when analyzing spatialized data, we find the funding for a variety of crops in different regions. In regional terms, the increase of the overall resources and contracts has been higher in the Northeast and North. Despite this expansion, these regions and public remain, in absolute terms, the minority accessing Pronaf despite amounting for most of Brazilian family farmers.},

De maneira geral, o trabalho mostra que há um marcante dualismo econômico e político entre a agricultura familiar e a agricultura patronal/agronegócio em constante disputa por fundos públicos no Brasil, levando à adoção de visões generalizantes pautadas em médias estatísticas dos indicadores censitários que tendem a desviar o foco das desigualdades gritantes prevalecentes no campo nacional. Em relação à agricultura familiar, apesar das melhorias na distribuição de renda e outros avanços verificados no limiar do século XXI, nota-se uma significativa heterogeneidade e desigualdade produtiva no interior do segmento, em que predomina um vasto contingente de produtores pobres ou extremamente pobres. Na base desse quadro social, frequentemente negligenciado nas análises que buscam ressaltar as virtudes da categoria de forma agregada a partir dos dados censitários, está uma herança histórica de diferenciação social, que se mantém e se agrava ao longo do tempo, devido, entre outros fatores, ao privilegiamento dos setores mais capitalizados do segmento na distribuição do crédito rural do Pronaf.Palavras-chaves: agricultura familiar; agronegócio; desigualdades econômicas; Pronaf},

In this paper, we evaluate potential livelihood impacts of the CAR and programs that facilitate CAR registration. We do so by developing a conceptual framework and using evidence from semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders including farmers, governments, and funding agencies. We find that while the CAR and programs facilitating CAR do not have explicit livelihood impact goals, they nonetheless affect livelihoods, both positively and negatively, depending on the initial amount of natural vegetation on farmers' properties, farmers' access to credit and infrastructure, and changing market conditions. We argue that environmental interventions and policies need to consider potential livelihood impacts, especially if the policy intervention area has high poverty rates.},

Here, we evaluated farm compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (revised in 2012) in Mato Grosso do Sul state, where agribusiness activities have already converted more than 70\% of native vegetation, Cerrado. We analysed the most recent version of the CAR dataset, using geographic information system analytical tools. We observed a positive relationship between compliance with the 20\% compulsory Legal Reserves and farm size class. We showed that larger, rather than smaller, farms have important effects on biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale. Large farms ({\textgreater} than 1000 ha), comprising 74.2\% of the study area, tended to show better compliance levels (51\%) than smaller properties (33\%). At the same time, they contain huge amount of land with native vegetation that lies outside Legal Reserves, and so may pose a risk for legal deforestation of near 2 million ha. We argue that a portfolio of socioeconomic incentives for restoration, protected areas, and no-net-loss components in agricultural programmes, are essential measures to increase compliance and halt deforestation in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. Moreover, we argue that considering property size improves the likelihood of success of such initiatives. Although acknowledging that landscape management can help address socioeconomic conflicts and improve food production, it must be accompanied by a strong “anti-deforestation” policy to guarantee the maintenance of existing native vegetation remnants. We also highlight the importance of investigating the role of property size in maintaining remaining vegetation in this region, instead of merely focused on the number of compliant farms.},

We argue that the dominant food regime has responded to this challenge by a ‘narrow’ ecological modernisation process within agriculture which may decrease environmental effects to a certain extent, but also causes new negative side-effects and exposes some important missing links. In this paper we explore what might be a ‘real’ ecological modernisation process, including social, cultural, spatial and political aspects. The central question concerns: is there evidence in practice that agro-ecological approaches can contribute to the future demand for food production, especially in developing countries? We illustrate this by describing examples from Africa, Brazil and China, showing a rich variety of such approaches in agricultural practices. Our conclusion is that agro-ecological approaches could significantly contribute to ‘feeding the world’, and thereby contribute to a ‘real green revolution’; but that this requires a more radical move towards a new type of regionally embedded agri-food eco-economy. This is one which includes re-thinking market mechanisms and organisations, an altered institutional context, and is interwoven with active farmers and consumers’ participation. It also requires a re-direction of science investments to take account of translating often isolated cases of good practice into mainstream agri-food movements.},

Here, we analysed land-use intensity of annual crop fields of 30 farms in northern Germany that were located in 15 landscapes differing in structural complexity ranging from {\textless}15\% to {\textgreater}65\% non-crop habitats. The proportion of arable land per landscape was used as simple predictor of landscape complexity due to its close correlation with habitat-type diversity, and the proportion of arable land per farm acted as an indicator for farm specialisation due to its negative correlation with stock farming. Land-use intensity was quantified using questionnaires. Landscape complexity and farm specialisation were related to several but not all indicators of land-use intensity. Structurally simple landscapes were related to more nitrogen input and higher crop yields, and farms specialised on annual crops had reduced crop-species diversity, larger fields, higher crop yields and more pathogen species. In contrast to general expectations, pesticide use in annual crop fields was exceptionally high and not a function of landscape complexity or farm specialisation. Our results show that generalisations such as “farms specialised on annual crops and structurally simple landscapes show increased land-use intensity” may be misleading.},

	abstract = {The Anthropocene epoch is partly defined by anthropogenic spread of crops beyond their centres of origin. At global scales, evidence indicates that species-level taxonomic diversity of crops being cultivated on large-scale agricultural lands has increased linearly over the past 50 years. Yet environmental and socio-economic differences support expectations that temporal changes in crop diversity vary across regions. Ecological theory also suggests that changes in crop taxonomic diversity may not necessarily reflect changes in the evolutionary diversity of crops. We used data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to assess changes in crop taxonomic- and phylogenetic diversity across 22 subcontinental-scale regions from 1961–2014. We document certain broad consistencies across nearly all regions: i) little change in crop diversity from 1961 through to the late 1970s; followed by ii) a 10-year period of sharp diversification through the early 1980s; followed by iii) a “levelling-off” of crop diversification beginning in the early 1990s. However, the specific onset and duration of these distinct periods differs significantly across regions and are unrelated to agricultural expansion, indicating that unique policy or environmental conditions influence the crops being grown within a given region. Additionally, while the 1970s and 1980s are defined by region-scale increases in crop diversity this period marks the increasing dominance of a small number of crop species and lineages; a trend resulting in detectable increases in the similarity of crops being grown across regions. Broad similarities in the species-level taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of crops being grown across regions, primarily at large industrial scales captured by FAO data, represent a unique feature of the Anthropocene epoch. Yet nuanced asymmetries in regional-scale trends suggest that environmental and socio-economic factors play a key role in shaping observed macro-ecological changes in the plant diversity on agricultural lands.},

Most crop production systems in the United States are characterized by low species and management diversity, high use of fossil energy and agrichemicals, and large negative impacts on the environment. We hypothesized that cropping system diversification would promote ecosystem services that would supplement, and eventually displace, synthetic external inputs used to maintain crop productivity. To test this, we conducted a field study from 2003–2011 in Iowa that included three contrasting systems varying in length of crop sequence and inputs. We compared a conventionally managed 2-yr rotation (maize-soybean) that received fertilizers and herbicides at rates comparable to those used on nearby farms with two more diverse cropping systems: a 3-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + red clover) and a 4-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + alfalfa-alfalfa) managed with lower synthetic N fertilizer and herbicide inputs and periodic applications of cattle manure. Grain yields, mass of harvested products, and profit in the more diverse systems were similar to, or greater than, those in the conventional system, despite reductions of agrichemical inputs. Weeds were suppressed effectively in all systems, but freshwater toxicity of the more diverse systems was two orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional system. Results of our study indicate that more diverse cropping systems can use small amounts of synthetic agrichemical inputs as powerful tools with which to tune, rather than drive, agroecosystem performance, while meeting or exceeding the performance of less diverse systems.},

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals propose full employment (SDG 8) and crop diversity (SDG 2), but it is unclear if there are trade-offs between these goals across rural landscapes worldwide. We tested this idea with agricultural and socio-economic data for 44 countries from all continents during a 15-year period (1999–2013). We show that countries where crop diversity increased also supported more agricultural jobs. Such effects were independent of differences among countries in the size of the agricultural sector or fertilizer use (a proxy for the investment in external inputs and technology incorporation). Greater crop diversity was also compatible with improved crop yields and was not confounded with changes in socio-economic development or economic growth. In general, we found no evidence that the jobs lost in the rural areas were incorporated into other sectors of the economy. Unemployment is a major concern affecting livelihoods all over the world; policies to enhance crop diversity and prevent the loss of associated agricultural jobs are urgently needed.},

Here we developed a systematic review to verify the existence of gaps and limitations in the use of scenarios for environmental restoration, and assess the state of the science of “restoration scenarios” and implications for future research. From 419 studies reviewed, most were held in developed countries, using exploratory scenarios at the regional scale, actively restoring ES and habitat at “habitat, ecosystems or communities” at landscape level, targeting forests and fragmented landscapes. The main gaps we identified were: few studies in tropical, marine, and urban environments, despite their importance for biodiversity and ES; few reports on global scales using target-seeking approach, despite the existence of global targets; small number of studies considered invertebrates and invasive species, neglecting many ecosystem services and disservices; lack of participatory and cost-effectiveness studies, revealing a disconnection between restoration research and socioeconomic context. The gaps identified might prevent the widespread use of scenarios for restoration planning, particularly the limited scales of analysis, the lack of participatory approaches, and weak cost consideration. We encourage the use of target-seeking scenarios, with clear objectives, stimulating collaboration among stakeholders seeking cost-effective restoration alternatives.},

	abstract = {Pollination by bees and other animals increases the size, quality, or stability of harvests for 70\% of leading global crops. Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively, conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we synthesize the results of 23 studies - representing 16 crops on five continents - to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi-natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply, dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat, compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set - variables that directly affect yields - is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions, and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity, and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people.},

	abstract = {1. The development of ecological networks could enhance the ability of species to disperse across fragmented landscapes and could mitigate against the negative impacts of climate change. The development of such networks will require widespread ecological restoration at the landscape scale, which is likely to be costly. However, little information is available regarding the cost-effectiveness of restoration approaches. 2. We address this knowledge gap by examining the potential impact of landscape-scale habitat restoration on the value of multiple ecosystem services across the catchment of the River Frome in Dorset, England. This was achieved by mapping the market value of four ecosystem services (carbon storage, crops, livestock and timber) under three different restoration scenarios, estimating restoration costs, and calculating net benefits. 3. The non-market value of additional services (cultural, aesthetic and recreational value) was elicited from local stakeholders using an online survey tool. Flood risk was assessed using a scoring approach. Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) was conducted, incorporating both market and non-market values, to evaluate the relative benefits of restoration scenarios. These were compared with impacts of restoration on biodiversity value. 4. Multi-Criteria Analysis results consistently ranked restoration scenarios above a non-restoration comparator, reflecting the increased provision of multiple ecosystem services. Restoration scenarios also provided benefits to biodiversity, in terms of increased species richness and habitat connectivity. However, restoration costs consistently exceeded the market value of ecosystem services. 5. Synthesis and applications. Establishment of ecological networks through ecological restoration is unlikely to deliver net economic benefits in landscapes dominated by agricultural land use. This reflects the high costs of ecological restoration in such landscapes. The cost-effectiveness of ecological networks will depend on how the benefits provided to people are valued, and on how the value of non-market benefits are weighted against the costs of reduced agricultural and timber production. Future plans for ecological restoration should incorporate local stakeholder values, to ensure that benefits to people are maximised.},

	abstract = {Measures aimed at conservation or restoration of ecosystems are often seen as net-cost projects by governments and businesses because they are based on incomplete and often faulty cost-benefit analyses. After screening over 200 studies, we examined the costs (94 studies) and benefits (225 studies) of ecosystem restoration projects that had sufficient reliable data in 9 different biomes ranging from coral reefs to tropical forests. Costs included capital investment and maintenance of the restoration project, and benefits were based on the monetary value of the total bundle of ecosystem services provided by the restored ecosystem. Assuming restoration is always imperfect and benefits attain only 75\% of the maximum value of the reference systems over 20 years, we calculated the net present value at the social discount rates of 2\% and 8\%. We also conducted 2 threshold cum sensitivity analyses. Benefit-cost ratios ranged from about 0.05:1 (coral reefs and coastal systems, worst-case scenario) to as much as 35:1 (grasslands, best-case scenario). Our results provide only partial estimates of benefits at one point in time and reflect the lower limit of the welfare benefits of ecosystem restoration because both scarcity of and demand for ecosystem services is increasing and new benefits of natural ecosystems and biological diversity are being discovered. Nonetheless, when accounting for even the incomplete range of known benefits through the use of static estimates that fail to capture rising values, the majority of the restoration projects we analyzed provided net benefits and should be considered not only as profitable but also as high-yielding investments.

	abstract = {At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable, multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy discussions at the landscape scale.},

Water quality planning aims to mitigate pollutant run-off through land management, including riparian and wetland restoration, but no tools exist to assess trade-offs in land use change across the catchment-to-reef continuum. We adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework in the GBR's Tully–Murray catchment to identify trade-offs between linked ecosystem services and stakeholders. Applying four land use scenarios we assessed outcomes for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation, and trade-offs with six floodplain services and four GBR services. Based on statistical correlations between ecosystem services’ status under the scenarios, we identified trade-offs and thresholds between services and associated stakeholders. The most direct trade-off in floodplain services (and primary stakeholders) was food and fibre production (farmers) versus water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen). There were synergies between water quality regulation (community, GBR tourists, tour operators and fishermen) and floodplain recreational and commercial fisheries (fishermen). Scale mis-matches between water quality management structures and ecosystem service flows were also evident. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this ecosystem services approach, and its potential application in the GBR and other catchment-to-reef social–ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Ants play a fundamental role in coffee pest control. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants’ ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40\%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40\% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Behavioral ecologists frequently use observational methods, such as instantaneous scan sampling, to record the behavior of animals at discrete moments in time. We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data. These statistical methods correspond to the multinomial character of the response variable while also accounting for the repeated observations of individuals that characterize behavioral datasets. Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the RStan package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

The modernization of agriculture has allowed high productivity, which is affected by the invasion of weeds. With sustainable agriculture, the use of herbicides has been increasingly avoided in society, requiring more effective weed control methods. In this paper, we propose a statistical model capable of identifying the invasion of weeds in the field, using four color spectra as regressor variables obtained by a multispectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. With the exact identification of the weed infestation, it is possible to carry out the management in the field with herbicide applications in the exact places, thus avoiding the increase of the cost of production or even dispensing with the use of herbicides, effecting the mechanical removal of them. Results show that in the experimental field, it was possible to reduce herbicide spraying by 57\%.},

It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassiﬁcation. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the deﬁnition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative deﬁnition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artiﬁcial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reﬂecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassiﬁcation.},

However, it is unclear how much biodiversity is needed to deliver ecosystem services in a cost-effective way. Here we show that, while the contribution of wild bees to crop production is significant, service delivery is restricted to a limited subset of all known bee species. Across crops, years and biogeographical regions, crop-visiting wild bee communities are dominated by a small number of common species, and threatened species are rarely observed on crops. Dominant crop pollinators persist under agricultural expansion and many are easily enhanced by simple conservation measures, suggesting that cost-effective management strategies to promote crop pollination should target a different set of species than management strategies to promote threatened bees. Conserving the biological diversity of bees therefore requires more than just ecosystem-service-based arguments.},

	abstract = {The cross-edge spillover of subsidized predators from anthropogenic to natural habitats is an important process affecting wildlife, especially bird, populations in fragmented landscapes. However, the importance of the spillover of insect natural enemies from agricultural to natural habitats is unknown, despite the abundance of studies examining movement in the opposite direction. Here, we synthesize studies from various ecological sub-disciplines to suggest that spillover of agriculturally subsidized insect natural enemies may be an important process affecting prey populations in natural habitat fragments. This contention is based on (1) the ubiquity of agricultural–natural edges in human dominated landscapes; (2) the substantial literature illustrating that crop and natural habitats share important insect predators; and (3) the clear importance of the landscape matrix, specifically distance to ecological edges, in influencing predator impacts in agroecosystems. Further support emerges from theory on the importance of cross-boundary subsidies for within site consumer–resource dynamics. In particular, high productivity and temporally variable resource abundance in agricultural systems are predicted to result in strong spillover effects. More empirical work examining the prevalence and significance of such natural enemy spillover will be critical to a broader understanding of fragmentation impacts on insect predator–prey interactions.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental consequences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth; caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility; contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems; accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

	abstract = {As efforts to mitigate climate change increase, there is a need to identify cost-effective ways to avoid emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Agriculture is rightly recognized as a source of considerable emissions, with concomitant opportunities for mitigation. Although future agricultural productivity is critical, as it will shape emissions from conversion of native landscapes to food and biofuel crops, investment in agricultural research is rarely mentioned as a mitigation strategy. Here we estimate the net effect on GHG emissions of historical agricultural intensification between 1961 and 2005. We find that while emissions from factors such as fertilizer production and application have increased, the net effect of higher yields has avoided emissions of up to 161 gigatons of carbon (GtC) (590 GtCO2e) since 1961. We estimate that each dollar invested in agricultural yields has resulted in 68 fewer kgC (249 kgCO2e) emissions relative to 1961 technology (\$14.74/tC, or ∼\$4/tCO2e), avoiding 3.6 GtC (13.1 GtCO2e) per year. Our analysis indicates that investment in yield improvements compares favorably with other commonly proposed mitigation strategies. Further yield improvements should therefore be prominent among efforts to reduce future GHG emissions.},

Despite being former, the sugarcane production in this territory was relatively unexpressive until the 1990s. Thereafter, the acreage increased significantly, intensifying itself particularly over the 2000s due to incentive programs of the government to the ethanol production, and increased global demand for renewable fuels and sugar. Therefore, this region known as ―Coffee Belt‖ since the late nineteenth century, has been suffering a process of simultaneous coexistence and productive restructuring of the coffee plantations and sugarcane, resulting in changes in rural and urban areas. Thereby, the present study investigated the implications of the sugarcane expansion in this region, such as modernization and loss of the agricultural diversity, land concentration, changes in the market and population dynamics. Analysis of the characters of the sugarcane industry productive space circuit and their respective cooperation circles show how these transformations in this region are happening due to productive reconversion of the agricultural space and its interactions with others agricultural activities, especially with the coffee plantations},

O trabalho utiliza dados de mais de 40 mil propriedades rurais para examinar a estrutura de produção e a especialização produtiva em onze regiões que cobrem a totalidade do território do estado de São Paulo no auge da economia cafeeira. Além das regiões, o artigo aborda como as propriedades rurais distribuíram seus recursos produtivos entre produto de exportação (café) e produtos destinados ao consumo interno. A análise traz à luz novas evidências, corroborando parte da literatura, mas divergindo de outras ideias estabelecidas na historiografia. No início do século XX, virtualmente todas as regiões de São Paulo produziam café, mas quase todas elas se especializaram em mais de um produto agrícola, com a exceção da região da Mogiana. Além das grandes propriedades ressaltadas na literatura, as pequenas propriedades também foram atraídas para a produção de exportação e se especializaram na produção do café. Por sua vez, as grandes propriedades não só se especializaram na produção de alimentos (além do café), mas dominaram a oferta dos principais produtos destinados ao mercado doméstico.Palavras-chave: Agricultura Cafeeira; Especialização Agrícola; São Paulo},

	abstract = {Agriculture is facing up to an increasing number of challenges, including the need to ensure various ecosystem services and to resolve apparent conflicts between them. One of the ways forward for agriculture currently being debated is a set of principles grouped together under the umbrella term “ecological intensification”. In published studies, ecological intensification has generally been considered to be based essentially on the use of biological regulation to manage agroecosystems, at field, farm and landscape scales. We propose here five additional avenues that agronomic research could follow to strengthen the ecological intensification of current farming systems. We begin by assuming that progress in plant sciences over the last two decades provides new insight of potential use to agronomists. Potentially useful new developments in plant science include advances in the fields of energy conversion by plants, nitrogen use efficiency and defence mechanisms against pests. We then suggest that natural ecosystems may also provide sources of inspiration for cropping system design, in terms of their structure and function on the one hand, and farmers’ knowledge on the other. Natural ecosystems display a number of interesting properties that could be incorporated into agroecosystems. We discuss the value and limitations of attempting to ‘mimic’ their structure and function, while considering the differences in objectives and constraints between these two types of system. Farmers develop extensive knowledge of the systems they manage. We discuss ways in which this knowledge could be combined with, or fed into scientific knowledge and innovation, and the extent to which this is likely to be possible. The two remaining avenues concern methods. We suggest that agronomists make more use of meta-analysis and comparative system studies, these two types of methods being commonly used in other disciplines but barely used in agronomy. Meta-analysis would make it possible to quantify variations of cropping system performances in interaction with soil and climate conditions more accurately across environments and socio-economic contexts. Comparative analysis would help to identify the structural characteristics of cropping and farming systems underlying properties of interest. Such analysis can be performed with sets of performance indicators and methods borrowed from ecology for analyses of the structure and organisation of these systems. These five approaches should make it possible to deepen our knowledge of agroecosystems for action.},

	abstract = {Sustainably feeding a growing population is a grand challenge1,2,3, and one that is particularly difficult in regions that are dominated by smallholder farming. Despite local successes4,5,6,7,8, mobilizing vast smallholder communities with science- and evidence-based management practices to simultaneously address production and pollution problems has been infeasible. Here we report the outcome of concerted efforts in engaging millions of Chinese smallholder farmers to adopt enhanced management practices for greater yield and environmental performance. First, we conducted field trials across China’s major agroecological zones to develop locally applicable recommendations using a comprehensive decision-support program. Engaging farmers to adopt those recommendations involved the collaboration of a core network of 1,152 researchers with numerous extension agents and agribusiness personnel. From 2005 to 2015, about 20.9 million farmers in 452 counties adopted enhanced management practices in fields with a total of 37.7 million cumulative hectares over the years. Average yields (maize, rice and wheat) increased by 10.8–11.5\%, generating a net grain output of 33 million tonnes (Mt). At the same time, application of nitrogen decreased by 14.7–18.1\%, saving 1.2 Mt of nitrogen fertilizers. The increased grain output and decreased nitrogen fertilizer use were equivalent to US\$12.2 billion. Estimated reactive nitrogen losses averaged 4.5–4.7 kg nitrogen per Megagram (Mg) with the intervention compared to 6.0–6.4 kg nitrogen per Mg without. Greenhouse gas emissions were 328 kg, 812 kg and 434 kg CO2 equivalent per Mg of maize, rice and wheat produced, respectively, compared to 422 kg, 941 kg and 549 kg CO2 equivalent per Mg without the intervention. On the basis of a large-scale survey (8.6 million farmer participants) and scenario analyses, we further demonstrate the potential impacts of implementing the enhanced management practices on China’s food security and sustainability outlook.},

A dynamic ecological economic simulation model was created to assess net benefits of production (i.e., economic rent) from groundwater management while requiring a producer to maintain or restore native groundwater dependent vegetation in a well -field in Owens Valley, California. Historic groundwater withdrawal during dry conditions followed by recharge during wet conditions has reduced vegetation cover, soil stability and contributed to the drying of springs and seeps. Findings indicate adaptive management that pumps less water, but high volumes in wet years and low volumes in dry years, generates greater economic rent while supplying water, sustaining alkali meadow and maintaining dust suppression. Adaptive management generates economic rent of \$82.6 million (in 2011 \$) compared to status quo management of \$30.5 million over 50 years pumping less annual groundwater than status quo at respective levels of 73\% (6830 acre -ft; baseline conditions) and 56\% (4952 acre -ft; climate change scenario). Under a climate change scenario and a 2.0 m root -zone or less, it would be cost effective to cease groundwater pumping rather than incur substantial restoration costs of the native plant community.

Cumulative effects and interdependencies of chronic co varying environmental stressors can obscure causal linkages that may be controlling the population dynamics of longer-lived freshwater fauna, such as mussels. To understand changes in long-term mussel population density, we developed a dynamic, process-based interaction model that couples streamflow, suspended sediment, phytoplankton, and mussel abundance under the hypothesis that chronic exposure to increased suspended sediment and food limitation are the primary factors controlling native mussel population density in a midwestern USA agricultural river basin. We calibrated and validated the model with extensive survey data from multiple time periods and used it to evaluate changes in mussel abundance at a subbasin scale over decades. We evaluated sensitivity of simulated mussel densities across a range of mortality rates and initial population densities. In scenarios representing altered sediment concentrations, such as might occur with climate or landuse-induced changes in streamflow or sediment generation rates, mussel population density showed critical threshold responses to long-term changes in suspended sediment concentration. This model of mussel population density can be used to test hypotheses about limiting factors, identify priority locations for restoration activities, and evaluate the effects of climate- or landuse-change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Projecting the response of forests to changing climate requires understanding how biotic and abiotic controls on tree growth will change over time. As temperature and interannual precipitation variability increase, the overall forest response is likely to be influenced by species-specific responses to changing climate. Management actions that alter composition and density may help buffer forests against the effects of changing climate, but may require tradeoffs in ecosystem services. We sought to quantify how projected changes in climate and different management regimes would alter the composition and productivity of Puget Lowland forests in Washington State, USA. We modeled forest responses to four treatments (control, burn-only, thin-only, thin-and-burn) under five different climate scenarios: baseline climate (historical) and projections from two climate models (CCSM4 and CNRM-CM5), driven by moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emission scenarios. We also simulated the effects of intensive management to restore Oregon white oak woodlands (Quercus garryana) for the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) and quantified the effects of these treatments on the probability of oak occurrence and carbon sequestration. At the landscape scale we found little difference in carbon dynamics between baseline and moderate emission scenarios. However, by late-century under the high emission scenario, climate change reduced forest productivity and decreased species richness across a large proportion of the study area. Regardless of the climate scenario, we found that thinning and burning treatments increased the carbon sequestration rate because of decreased resource competition. However, increased productivity with management was not sufficient to prevent an overall decline in productivity under the high emission scenario. We also found that intensive oak restoration treatments were effective at increasing the probability of oak presence and that the limited extent of the treatments resulted in small declines in total ecosystem carbon across the landscape as compared to the thin-and-burn treatment. Our research suggests that carbon dynamics in this system under the moderate emission scenario may be fairly consistent with the carbon dynamics under historical climate, but that the high emission scenario may alter the successional trajectory of these forests.

In this research article, in-depth interview and questionnaire data (n = 340) about demography and perceptions were examined from both qualitative and quantitative information. Respondents have expressed their perception about their own territories, problems, attachments, positive or negative change that occurred during their stay in and around protected area. Respondents overall positive attitudes towards conservation scenarios despite high losses from wildlife while living around protected area suggest that they may support conservation if their livelihood needs are met. Most of the respondents support the concept of conservation, and some respondents have negative attitude towards management authorities, mainly because of restricted access to the forest resources. The study illustrates and suggests a number of options for the viability of resettlement of pastoralist community. A majority of respondents indicated that there is a need for public participation in planning and implementation of resettlement process. Resettlement of Van Gujjar community may be better if exercised with the consensus of all the stakeholders. Resettlement will provide better livelihood opportunity to the pastoral community and enhance the economic status of these people as the educational level increases in time, while also improving habitat recovery leading to better biodiversity conservation. Thus, resettlements could benefit both the pastoral people and the natural resources.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of historical abundance provides an essential baseline for judging the recovery of the great whales. This is particularly challenging for whales hunted prior to twentieth century modern whaling, as population-level catch records are often incomplete. Assessments of whale recovery using pre-modern exploitation indices are therefore rare, despite the intensive, global nature of nineteenth century whaling. Right whales (Eubalaena spp.) were particularly exploited: slow swimmers with strong fidelity to sheltered calving bays, the species made predictable and easy targets. Here, we present the first integrated population-level assessment of the whaling impact and pre-exploitation abundance of a right whale, the New Zealand southern right whale (E. australis). In this assessment, we use a Bayesian population dynamics model integrating multiple data sources: nineteenth century catches, genetic constraints on bottleneck size and individual sightings histories informing abundance and trend. Different catch allocation scenarios are explored to account for uncertainty in the population's offshore distribution. From a pre-exploitation abundance of 28 800-47 100 whales, nineteenth century hunting reduced the population to approximately 30-40 mature females between 1914 and 1926. Today, it stands at less than 12\% of pre-exploitation abundance. Despite the challenges of reconstructing historical catches and population boundaries, conservation efforts of historically exploited species benefit from targets for ecological restoration.},

	abstract = {Forest managers are faced with the difficulty of promoting multiple ecosystem services (ES) with an incomplete understanding of the complex ways these ES interact. We developed a quantitative model to help managers better understand the effect of different management options on eight ES over time. These ES were (1) Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) habitat, (2) the harvest of merchantable timber, (3) the harvest of woody biomass for potential conversion to bioenergy, (4) northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) habitat, (5) scenic beauty, (6) fire hazard reduction, (7) carbon storage, and (8) restoration of pre-European settlement forest structure represented through larger quadratic mean diameters (QMD). We integrated production functions for these eight ES with a forest growth-and-yield model to simulate the effects of three management actions over a 45-year period in northern Arizona, USA. We scaled ES values based on their observed maximum and minimum values as a means to compare achievement levels between ES. These scaled ES values were input into a goal-programming model to identify the optimal management regimes given a corresponding set of five different management objectives. The combination of simulation modeling with goal-programming is a novel approach for evaluating ES responses to management and for optimizing ES attainment objectives. To illustrate the value of this novel approach, we designed management objectives to reflect the likely goals a forest manager may choose for each ES in this region. ES goals were distinguished at the forest- and stand-level spatial extents. Results demonstrate the flexibility of the ES optimization model to plan for a variety of situations and preferences. For instance, two ES management goals viewed as conflicting are the protection of Mexican Spotted Owl habitat and the reduction of fire hazard risk. One ES optimization scenario (Scenario 5) produces a plan that reduces area considered as having a high fire hazard from 56\% to 7\% of the study area in 2015 without any reduction in owl habitat quality throughout the time horizon. We recommend that our methodology be applied and developed further by those in both the research and applied fields of ecosystem sciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soil contaminant concentration limits for the protection of terrestrial plants and soil invertebrates are commonly based on thresholds derived using data from laboratory ecotoxicity tests. A comprehensive assessment has been made for the derivation of ecological soil screening levels (Eco-SSL) in the United States; however, these limits are conservative because of their focus on high bioavailability scenarios. Here, we explain and evaluate approaches to soil limit derivation taken by 4 jurisdictions, 2 of which allow for correction of data for factors affecting bioavailability among soils, and between spiked and field-contaminated soils (Registration Evaluation Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals [REACH] Regulation, European Union [EU], and the National Environment Protection Council [NEPC], Australia). Scientifically advanced features from these methods have been integrated into a newly developed method for deriving soil clean-up values (SCVs) within the context of site-specific baseline ecological risk assessment. Resulting site-specific SCVs that account for bioavailability may permit a greater residual concentration in soil when compared to generic screening limit concentrations (e.g., Eco-SSL), while still affording acceptable protection. Two choices for selecting the level of protection are compared (i.e., allowing higher effect levels per species, or allowing a higher percentile of species that are potentially unprotected). Implementation of this new method is presented for the jurisdiction of the United States, with a focus on metal and metalloid contaminants; however, the new method can be used in any jurisdiction. A case study for molybdate shows the large effect of bioavailability corrections and smaller effects of protection level choices when deriving SCVs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}list list-type="1" id="jpe12189-list-0001"{\textgreater} Tree recruitment in Mediterranean ecosystems is strongly limited at the seedling stage by drought. Increasing evidence shows the critical positive role of the canopy nurse effect on seedling survival which results from direct and indirect, positive and negative interactions between species. Most studies, however, have only focused on the effects of tree canopy on water and light, ignoring other critical factors affecting seedling regeneration, such as canopy effects on high temperatures and the competing herb biomass. Here, we evaluate how tree canopy cover and removal of herbs affect the survival and growth of seedlings of two dominant Mediterranean Quercus species during a 3-year study. We use an integrated model that combines several data sets to quantify and predict regeneration dynamics along environmental gradients of soil moisture, temperature and light. Low soil moisture, increased soil temperature and herb biomass negatively affected seedling survival of both Quercus species. Seedling growth was positively associated with increasing soil moisture and light. Although tree canopy cover directly facilitated seedling survival in both Quercus species, it also negatively affected herb biomass and thus indirectly facilitated the survival of Quercus suber, but not of Quercus ilex seedlings at low levels of soil moisture. Overall, tree canopies increased seedling survival but not growth during the establishment phase, mainly by ameliorating the effects of low soil moisture and high temperatures. Tree canopy indirectly facilitated survival of Q.suber seedlings by negatively affecting the competing herb layer.Synthesis and applications. To improve tree recruitment and conserve Mediterranean Quercus woodlands, the removal of herbs should be integrated into management plans for dry habitats. Interactions between abiotic and biotic factors may also effect the regeneration of these tree species. In particular, a healthy tree canopy will become important for providing conditions to facilitate seedling establishment if these habitats become drier and warmer, as predicted by some climate change scenarios.

	abstract = {The E2 modelling system is a powerful software tool developed to enable catchment managers and planners to investigate the interactions of land use, climate, water quality and water quantity. E2 forms the basis of a Decision Support System (DSS) developed for the Corner Inlet catchment in South Gippsland, Victoria. The purpose of the DSS is to inform catchment management, via modelling of the terrestrial and estuarine impacts of scenarios of land use or land management change. This is achieved by linking together an E2 model of sediment and nutrient delivery from the catchment with a model of estuarine water quality impacts derived from detailed 3-D hydrodynamic simulation of the estuarine transport. The model can be used to run scenarios of land use or land management change in the terrestrial catchment (e.g. reforestation) with the results being examined for impacts on the estuary or on the modelled streams. The underlying hydrodynamic model was developed using MIKE21, and calibrated against gauged tidal records at 5 different locations throughout Corner Inlet and Nooramunga. Model parameters were calibrated in an effort to minimise differences between the measured and modelled water surface elevations and tidal constituents (amplitude and phase angle). The calibrated and measured tidal constituents were also verified against the Australian National Tide Tables and those reported in the literature. The IOS (Institute of Ocean Sciences) method was applied for the decomposition of tidal constituents. The advection-dispersion simulations of the estuary were analysed to develop a statistical link between constituent inflows and transport to important seagrass beds. This transport was treated as conservative due to limited data on nutrient transformations within Corner Inlet. For similar reasons, the State Environment Protection Policy was used to define critical water quality thresholds in Corner Inlet. The hydrological and water quality models within E2 have been used in this particular E2 application. The SimHyd model was used to simulate the rainfall-runoff response, with calibration against existing stream flow stations and fitting of separate parameter sets for forested and non-forested landuses. Existing monitoring data from various sources were used to parameterize and calibrate "constituent" models within E2 for nitrogen (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, NOx), phosphorus (Total Phosphorus, Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus) and suspended sediment generation. The choice of constituents for this study came about partly over concerns that elevated concentrations of nitrogen in the estuary were causing a decrease in the seagrass population in Corner Inlet. Concern has also been raised for several decades that high levels of phosphorus in coastal waterways in south-eastern Australia may contribute to the development of algal blooms and coastal eutrophication. A review of the existing data sources found that although the database of weekly and monthly water quality samples was reasonably extensive spatially (especially for Phosphorus) and covered a period of at least ten years of monitoring, the monitoring data lacked sufficient samples taken at high flow periods, classified as runoff events. Evidence from the samples taken during events was that the loads of nutrients and sediments transported during high runoff periods contributed over 90\% of the total monitored load. Also, there was a paucity of nitrogen (including nitrate and ammonia) measurements in this particular catchment. Therefore, a monitoring program was devised to collect water quality samples from six streams and rivers at eight locations using automatic samplers. The data collected have been used to improve the calibration of the E2 model, especially for high-flow periods.},

	abstract = {The Picayune Strand Restoration Project (PSRP), sponsored by the South Florida Water Management District and the US Army Corps of Engineers, aims to restore 95 square miles of drained wetland areas in Collier County, Florida, to its natural condition. The over-drainage of this area because of land development activity in the 1950s has had several detrimental ecological and hydrologic impacts, including reduction of groundwater levels, increased freshwater inflow to critical estuaries, increase of invasive exotic vegetation and upland species, increased fire frequency, and loss of wildlife habitat connectivity. The restoration of the Picayune Strand is an extremely important element of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) project, because it is located at the center of critical preserved areas that serve as wildlife habitat and because it serves as the headwaters of the Ten Thousand Islands estuary. To evaluate a restoration scenario proposed in an earlier study, two integrated surface water and groundwater models were developed for the area using the MIKE SHE/ MIKE 11 applications. One of these, described in Part I of this series of papers, is a hydrologic design tool (HDT) which addresses surface water hydraulic conditions that govern facility placement, sizing and design. The other is a planning and evaluation tool created to enable evaluation of watershed habitat and surface water responses. Calibration of the second application is described in Part II of this series, while this paper (Part III) focuses on the application of that model to evaluate the system. This application was unusually complex, partly because of the intimate interrelationships between surface and groundwater conditions in this region, and partly because of the physical scope of the project. The proposed restoration project includes i) construction of three high capacity pump stations with a total capacity of 4,700 cfs, ii) construction of a spreader canal network intended to distribute water to historic flow ways, iii) partial backfilling of the existing drainage network, and iv) removal of roads within the strand. Consequently, the model suite had to consider long-term responses of the surface water and groundwater system associated with rather extensive changes in drainage features. Results of the model application indicate the proposed plan is sufficient to restore the extent of historic flow ways and hydro-periods, and together with results from the earlier HDT demonstrates that it will not increase flooding in neighboring urban areas or otherwise affect private lands, transportation corridors or other critical built infrastructure elements. The paper discusses and contrasts the ways that transportation, wildlife, urban development and other perspectives were addressed and resolved using this suite of tools.

LocationEurope. MethodWe modelled the response of European vegetation to changes in land use, climate and CO2 by combining the land-use model Dyna-CLUE (based on the CORINE land-cover data) and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Two reforestation options were explored: maintaining the current range of tree species (EFI) or promoting naturally occurring tree species (NAT). Climate data from two general circulation models and two SRES scenarios (A2 and B1) were used. The broad habitat types were classified according to a combination of land use and the dominant plant species. ResultsOur models predicted that croplands and grasslands are expected to decrease due to land-use change. Although climate change has a negative effect on needle-leaved forest, it is expected to maintain its area or even increase in the EFI reforestation option while mediterranean, broad-leaved and mixed forests are expected to increase markedly. All investigated drivers have shown some effect, but land use is the dominant contributor to broad habitat change except for needle-leaved and mixed which are mainly influenced by climate change. Main conclusionsLand use is predicted to have the greatest effect on broad habitat distribution according to our simulations. Hence in most parts of Europe mitigating actions should focus on land-use change rather than climate change. According to our simulation, the effects of the different drivers are not in general additive. In some cases they act synergistically and in some cases antagonistically. The projected habitat changes are a valuable tool for species distribution modelling and are available online.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien plants (IAPs) have successfully invaded many riparian zones in South Africa, especially Australian Acacia spp. which are prevalent along riverbanks in the south-western Cape of South Africa. This Mediterranean-type climate region is predicted to endure severe future water shortages under likely scenarios of increased population growth and climate change, and IAPs aggravate this problem due to their profligate water use. Acacia mearnsii competes aggressively with native species, however, it remains unclear what physiological advantage the species has over co-occurring native species under the predicted reduced streamflow scenarios. A mechanistic approach was used to investigate how key native fynbos riparian woody tree species compare in vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation against A. mearnsii by comparing findings from three Mediterranean-type fynbos river systems that differ in streamflow. A. mearnsii showed lower water potential at 50\% hydraulic conductivity loss (P-50 values) compared to native species at certain sites, an indication of drought-tolerance. This suggests it is likely to persist under future drier conditions and it therefore remains a top priority for control. The native Brabejum stellatifolium had consistently higher water potentials across all sites than the other studied species, and is a potentially valuable species for restoration of south-western Cape riparian zones. Consistency in the shapes of species vulnerability curves across sites illustrated a species-specific hydraulic response to different water availability, strengthening the argument that this approach to distinguish site-level drought-tolerance between trees is a practical technique, with great application in understanding future geographic distribution under climate change, and potential for use in restoration research. Additionally, streamflow was an inaccurate predictor of species drought-tolerance along these riparian systems.},

In addition, these models can provide insight on plant life history patterns and processes important for persistence and recovery of populations in changing environments. In this study, we evaluated a set of ecological restoration alternatives for their long-term effects on buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), a shrub common in understories of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the southwestern United States. The field data were collected from a set of forest restoration units located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest. We constructed simple stage-based models in order to simulate 25-year population dynamics. Results showed that scenarios that included overstory thinning, herbivore protection, and prescribed fire resulted in buckbrush populations with significantly greater numbers of aboveground stems than populations in the other alternatives. Vegetative stem recruitment, flowering, and seedling emergence were important in producing these results. For alternatives that included protection from herbivores, burning at 2-year frequencies resulted in populations with significantly greater numbers of aboveground stems than scenarios with longer intervals between burning. In contrast, frequent burning in alternatives without herbivore protection resulted in population decline. These results indicate that protecting buckbrush from large herbivores allowed plants to complete life cycles and fully express these life history traits. This research demonstrates that population modeling can help illuminate ecological tradeoffs associated with land management alternatives.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services are required to sustain human life and enhance its quality. Hence, environmental security must come from protecting and managing those services. Ecological risk assessment can predict and estimate effects of proposed actions, but it is insufficient alone for two reasons. First, it can fail because of inadequate application, unforeseen stressors, or unpredictable effects. Second, in many cases ecosystem services that sustain life are already impaired, resulting in reduced human welfare. For these reasons, environmental security requires the development of ecoepidemiology, a science that will identify impaired ecosystem services and determine the causes of impairment so that remediation and restoration can occur. A method for causal analysis, developed to identify causes of impairment in aquatic ecosystems, may provide a template that can be adapted to identify the causes of diminished ecosystem services and the resulting reductions in human welfare. Some of the challenges for adapting the existing method include explicitly defining ecosystem services required to sustain human life, appropriately matching the scale of the analysis to the ecological processes that deliver those services, and possibly customizing the logical considerations used in causal analysis. Advancing the science of ecoepidemiology holds the promise of helping scientists frame and guide rational debate, providing a sound basis from which to launch risk assessment and risk management scenarios, and ultimately informing environmental decision-making that affects human welfare, development and environmental security within acceptable risks.},

However, as the estuary recovered, biomass became more distributed among different trait categories, consistent with increases in FD when the seagrass started to increase.

Ecological characteristics of the species were considered, including tolerance to climate change. Inventories of shrubs were carried out in 17 semiarid shrubland fragments of xeric shrubland. The 46 species recorded were ordered using a principal component analysis, considering ecological characteristics such as frequency, land cover, sociability and interaction with mycorrhizal fungi. From these, the 10 species that presented the highest values of the desired characteristics were selected. The response of these species to climate change was evaluated using current potential distribution models and by applying climate change scenario A2, using MaxEnt. The species that presented suitable ecological qualities for restoration and maintained or increased their distribution under the climate change scenario were Acacia sthaffneri,Ageratina espinosarum, Bursera fagaroides, Dalea bicolor, Eysenhardtia polystachya and Karwinskia humboldtiana. These species are therefore recommended for use in medium and long-term ecological restoration projects in the semi-arid region in Central Mexico. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using this methodology, we quantified: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem's historical, current and future decline in spatial distribution; (ii) the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for the mountain ash ecosystem; and (iii) the decline in key abiotic and biotic processes and features for historical, current and future time periods. We developed a probabilistic model of tree growth stages to estimate the risk of ecosystem collapse within 50 to 100 years in the mountain ash forest. There was uncertainty in our estimates of risk under the various IUCN criteria, with two sub-criteria being categorized as Data Deficient'. Our overall ranking of risk of collapse for the ecosystem was Critically Endangered. We are confident that this risk category is appropriate because all 39 scenarios modelled indicated a 92\% chance of ecosystem collapse by 2067. Our findings highlight the important need for timely policy reform to facilitate improved management of the mountain ash ecosystem in Victoria. In particular, there needs to be greater protection of remaining areas of unburned forest, and restoration activities in parts of the forest estate. Implementation of these strategies will require a significant reduction in logging pressure on the mountain ash ecosystem.},

Here we describe a protocol for characterizing risks in the ecosystems of several polluted soil scenarios in the Madrid Community (Central Spain). Our starting hypothesis was that to recover the health of degraded ecosystems that could affect public health, an ecotoxicological diagnosis of each site is required. The sites we considered were industrial and urban solid waste landfills and abandoned mines. This diagnosis revealed many interacting processes that need to be assessed if we are to realistically address the issue of restoring impacts on ecosystems affected by soil pollution. These processes are: 1) Geo-edaphic processes, requiring the analysis of geomorphologic factors; 2) Chemical-physical processes occurring in the soils, such as the release of anions or cations; 3) Erosion-pollution processes that require an understanding of the autoecology of plant species that could be used for remediation in scenarios with this dual problem; 4) Bioaccumulation-biodegradation processes, requiring the integration of microbiology and plant biology tools to assess any toxic effects on soil and plant subsystem populations; 5) Edaphic-bioavailability processes, since different ecotypes show a varying response to a given soil; 6) Population-ecopathology development processes, essential for both cultivated and native plant species comprising trophic networks; 7) Secondary-primary ecological succession processes, a commonly observed mechanism in old landfills sealed with soils from the surroundings-ecological knowledge of reference communities is essential for a good ecotoxicological diagnosis.; 8) Climate change-global warming processes, of utmost importance for revegetating polluted soils since success will depend both on the soil seed bank and on stochastic processes.},

	abstract = {The Ecosystem Service Paradigm (EsSP) is increasingly a component or even an underlying principle of environmental policy, legislation and management internationally. The EsSP can be used to define links between human activities and ecosystems, and ecosystems and the services that in turn support and sustain those and other activities; this information can then be used to evaluate, justify or optimize decisions. However, how EsS within various practical applications and frameworks are applied, defined, quantified, modelled, valued and communicated ranges widely, potentially hindering their roles as cross-sectoral tools. For this paradigm to be useful for cross-disciplinary integration, it is important that practitioners in different fields are clear about what is meant and assumed when terms are used, and within what context assessments are being carried out. The logic behind practical applications of the EsSP can be explained by the EsS Decision Cascade, a three-part, iterative conceptual framework. Within the decision cascade, Ecosystem Service Decision Analysis (EsSD) defines the proposed policies or actions (scenarios), and the changes/pressures under consideration in different scenarios. Within the context laid out by EsSD, Ecosystem Service Assessment (EsSA) will then evaluate how such changes affect biophysical structure, and thus ecosystem function and services; Ecosystem Service Valuation (EsSV) then takes the results from these analyses and generates valuations to inform decisions; linking back to EsSD. EsS-based evaluations can expand the current risk-focused thinking behind ecological risk assessment (ERA) to consider trade-offs between a range of desirable and undesirable responses of a variety of ecosystem endpoints; such an assessment can be termed an Ecosystem Response Assessment (EcoResA), or if applied in a spatially explicit manner, an Ecosystem Regional Assessment (EcoRegA); understanding of such trade-offs is essential to inform decisions about more sustainable remediation, regulation and management of landscapes and resources. This paper describes "taxonomies" of various aspects of EsSP applications, based upon their decision context, perspective and assessment approach. It then examines, with a focus on European issues, a range of current and emerging regulatory and management applications to which the EsSP can be applied in light of this taxonomy.},

	abstract = {In recent years, methodology of ecological risk assessment has been developed and applied frequently for addressing various circumstances where ecological impacts are suspected or have occurred due to environmental contamination; however, its practice is very limited in Taiwan. In 1982, brown rice from rice paddy fields in Da-Tan, Tau-Yuan, was found to be contaminated with Cd and Pb due to illegal discharges of wastewater, known as the "Cd rice" incidence. Cadmium laden soil was transferred to a constructed landfill in an industrial park 15 years after the incident. Possible leakage of the landfill was suspected by committee members of a supervising board for the remediation process, and a preliminary ecological risk evaluation was requested. A possible risk scenario was that groundwater contamination due to the leachate containing Cd and Pb from the landfill could result in pollution of coastal water, and subsequently produce toxic effects to aquatic organisms. Chemical dissipation in groundwater systems was simulated and short-term chronic toxicity tests on larvae of three local aquatic species were also performed to determine the no-observed adverse-effect concentrations (NOAECs), as well as the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs), of the two metals in the organisms tested. The hazard quotient (HQ), the ratio of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) to PNECs, was used for risk characterization. A worst-case-scenario calculation showed that the maximum Cd concentration at 60 m and farther downstream from the site in the groundwater system would be 0.0028 mg l(-1) with a maximum initial concentration of 0.65 mg l(-1) in the leachate, while for Pb, the highest concentration of 0.044 mg l(-1) would be reached at a distance of 40 m and farther, which was based on an initial concentration of 4.4 mg l(-1) in the leachate; however, both cases would only occur 80 years after the initiation of leakage. A presumed dilution factor of 100 was used to calculate the PECs based on the maximum initial concentrations. The Cd and Pb's PNECs for three aquatic animals were 0.01 to approximately 0.1 mg l(-1), higher than their PECs in coastal water, resulting in HQs less than 1 for the scenario described. We concluded that if a leakage does occur, the ecological impact would be minimal because a majority of the metals will be retained in the soil phase and the remaining, if released into the aquatic system, cannot reach high enough concentrations to produce toxicity to marine animals.},

	abstract = {This chapter approaches the economic valuation of environmental
impacts related to soil erosion and silting-up of water streams, designed
to allow the transfer of recovery costs to a policy of payment for
ecosystem services. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution
of silting-up mitigation to funding the environmental recovery of riparian
areas found in sugarcane farms. The city selected for study is Arealva,
located in the Central-West region of São Paulo State, Southeast of
Brazil. Spatial dynamic models were conceived to simulate past land
cover/land use changes (2005-2010) and future landscape scenarios
(2010-2020) in the study area. The main observed changes that took place
from 2005 to 2010 were: sugarcane expansion (6,012.71ha (49.68\%)),
mostly extending over grazing lands, and deforestation (3,107.16ha
(22.33\%)), predominantly converted into pastures. Three sets of scenarios
were defined: i) stationary scenarios, in which the transition rates
observed in former years were held constant (business as usual); ii) nonstationary
scenarios with a partial recovery of environmentally protected
areas along riversides (70\% by 2015), and; iii) non-stationary scenarios
with a full recovery of environmentally protected areas along riversides
(100\% by 2015). The regarded impacts are dependent on the estimated
amount of lost soil, assessed by means of the Universal Soil Loss
Equation (USLE). We also estimated the sediment accumulation rate in
order to calculate siltation. The envisaged scenarios for environmental
recovery can reduce environmental impacts up to 16\% (US\$41,479.29 to
US\$56,789.40) yearly. The riparian and alike vulnerable areas (prone to
erosion and silting-up) can be recovered through a financing mechanism,
relying either on water use charging or even on a taxation strategy
implicitly considering the payment for ecosystem services. The silting
mitigation would approximately contribute with US\$13.83 to US\$18.94
ha-1.year-1. In this way, sugarcane farms would have a financial incentive
to restore and maintain the environmentally protected areas within their
domain, reducing the environmental impacts related to silting-up
processes.},

Article  12  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  Kyoto
Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Some of the issues, which need to be addressed,
include identifying the types of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities in LULUCF, which could
be undertaken as CDM projects. Other issues involve evaluating the mitigation potential and cost
effectiveness of the activities, as well as their likely socio-economic impacts and their influence on
the national carbon (C) stock. Three broad categories of mitigation activities in LULUCF analyzed
in this study include managing C storage, C conservation and carbon substitution. The C intensity of
the activities was estimated to range from 37 to 218 Mg C per ha. The highest is in reforested land
with slow growing species and the lowest in short-rotation plantations. At a real discount rate of 10\%,
investment costs required to implement the mitigation activities ranged from US\$ 0.07 to 0.88 per
Mg C, with life cycle costs ranging from US\$ 0.07 to 3.87 per Mg C, and benefits ranging from US\$
–0.81 to 6.57 per Mg C. Mitigation options with negative benefits are forest protection, reforestation,
reduced impact logging and enhanced  natural regeneration, while those with positive  benefits are
short rotation timber plantation, and bio-energy. Reforestation gave negative benefit since no revenue
from wood as trees are left in the forest for conservation, while Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) and
Enhanced Natural Regeneration (ENR) gave negative benefits because additional cost required to
implement the options could not be compensated by the increase in round-hardwood  yield. Other
factor is that the local price of round-hardwood is very low, i.e. US\$160 per m3, while FOB price
is between 250–400 US\$ per m3. Total area available for implementing mitigation options (planting
trees) in 1997 was 31 million hectares (×106ha) (about 40\% are critical lands, 35\% grasslands and
25\% unproductive lands). Total area being considered for implementing the options under baseline,
government-plans and mitigation scenarios in the period 2000–2030 is 12.6, 16.3 and 23.6×106ha
respectively. Furthermore, total area of production forest being considered for implementing reduced
impact logging and enrichment planting under the tree scenarios is 9, 26 and 16×106ha respectively,
and that for forest protection is 2.1, 3.7, 3.1×106 ha respectively. The cumulative investment for
implementing  all  mitigation activities in the  three scenarios  was  estimated  at  595,  892  and  1026
million US\$ respectively.  National  C stock under  the baseline scenario  will continuously  decline
through 2030, while under government-plans and mitigation scenarios the carbon stock increases. In
2030, national C stock of the government and mitigation scenarios is almost the same, 13\% higher
than that of  baseline.  However,  the  increase  in national  carbon stock  in both scenarios  could not
offset carbon emissions due to deforestation},

	abstract = {Biotic communities subject to productive transformation - and social relations among stake-holders involved in their management - are complex, nonlinear, adaptive processes. The inner workings and potential behaviors of such processes are not always easily grasped. It is important to help people understand the dynamic nature of sustainability attributes and to better address the issues, tradeoffs and conflicts associated with sustainable management of natural resources. We have developed a number of graphic, interactive simulation tools - coupled with role-playing games - that allow stakeholders to explore scenarios and negotiate collective decisions regarding such management. The free-ware tool described here is called "Negotiated Design of Sustainable Production Systems among Social Agents with Conflicting Interests" (www.ecosur.mx/sustentabilidad). It is an interactive drama in three acts. In act 1, users play the role of slash-and-burn farmers compelled by the government to leave a biodiversity reserve zone and to intensify maize production in a smaller area using nitrogen fertilizer. Users simulate production under different fertilization scenarios and decide if they can sustain their families under the government's proposal. In act 2, other users play the role of rural families who depend on ecotourism in a clear lake downhill and who anticipate that their livelihood could be threatened by lake eutrophication caused by nitrogen runoff. As part of the negotiations with uphill farmers, they need to know how much N can lixiviate from the fields before the lake becomes murky. Time series, coupled with parameter-sensitive cup and marble models that run as real-time animations, allow the user to better understand the dynamics of this bi-stable lake ecosystem. In act 3, stakeholders negotiate possible solutions, combining computer use and group dramatization. They search for nitrogen management strategies based on maize monocrop and maize-leguminous shrub systems. Technical decisions change output variables that are monitored through a graphical multi-criteria analysis of environmental and social sustainability attributes. Results from 12 workshops show that participants usually come up with creative solutions that meet the biodiversity conservation and rural livelihood interests of all stakeholders involved. Through these dynamical modeling games, users better grasp the meaning of productivity, stability; resistance, resilience, reliability, adaptability and equity. They also understand concepts such as bi-stability, thresholds, risk, catastrophic shift, hysteresis and restoration. Ultimately, they get an opportunity to become familiar with more creative and open-minded attitudes when defending interests and making collective decisions in a multi-stakeholder environment.},

As a first: aspect, we investigated whether or not expected payments for avoided deforestation would be acceptable for tropical farmers in Southern Ecuador with the study area located directly adjacent to the Podocarpus National Park. Second, we explored possible distributional effects resulting from voluntary or mandatory remuneration schemes to avoid deforestation. Finally, a productive sustainable land use,vas conceptualised to be combined with payments For avoided deforestation to avoid leakage (i.e. deforestation processes elsewhere when avoided at a given farm). Farm level land use scenarios with ("business as usual") and without deforestation ("conservation strategy") were compared. Compensation per Mg Carbon (C) that is not emitted into the atmosphere under the "conservation strategy" was derived to achieve a monetary land net present value (NPV, sum of discounted future net revenues) equal to the NPV obtained under "business as usual'. Avoided carbon emissions were computed from above ground C in tropical forests of the project area and supplemented by In(130 formation on soil carbon from another study Economic data for cattle pasturing were obtained from a farm survey (130 households) to investigate distributional effects. To derive sustainable land use concepts, a risk sensitive bioeconomic farm model was used that considered effects of risk compensation when combining pasture with reforestation of abandoned farm lands and selective logging of natural forests. The results showed that only a few farmers (20 out of 130) would possibly accept a compensation price of US\$ 10 per Mg avoided C emission, a C-compensation that is believed by other authors to reduce deforestation by 65\%. Rather a compensation of around US\$ 25 per Mg C was necessary to address compensation requirements of farmers who hold 50\% of the tropical forest area in our study. The implementation of a voluntary remuneration scheme for avoided deforestation would not introduce systematic distributional effects (such as that only the biggest farmers would benefit from compensation), while a mandatory and enforced ban on deforestation coupled with a "fair" compensation payment equal to mean compensation requirements may lead to undesirable effects for many farmers. Finally, we demonstrate a mixed sustainable land use concept that depended on cheap credits for reforestation of abandoned pasture lands. This concept was able to stop farm level deforestation and to enlarge the economic value of farms through various combined land use options (agricultural and forestry options). The combination of land uses led to risk compensatory), effects and a more efficient land use by reintegrating unproductive abandoned areas back into the economical process. I In our conclusion a combination of payments for avoided deforestation along with productive land use concepts provided a viable solution for tropical forest conservation.},

	abstract = {The effects on timber supply incurred by implementing an ecosystem-based management strategy were evaluated in an eastern Canadian boreal forest management unit. Standard linear programming was used to test the effects of four key policy issues: (1) aim for a targeted forest age structure inspired by natural fire regime and forest dynamics (multi-cohort approach), (2) agglomerate harvest blocks in operating areas to reproduce natural disturbance patterns at the landscape scale, (3) maintain cumulated clearcutting and natural disturbance rates inside the historical range of variability, and (4) exclude from harvest areas of potential interest to aboriginal people. The targeted forest age structure was achieved with a minimum reduction of periodic timber supply, but only after 50 years. Compared to a "business-as-usual" scenario, inclusion of the first three policy issues resulted in a 3\% to 11\% reduction in planned timber supply and a restoration period requiring that 43\% to 67\% of the productive area be excluded from clearcutting activities for the next 50 years. Such results require that partial cutting not be confined to operating areas eligible for clearcutting. Further exclusion of forest areas of potential interest to aboriginal people resulted in an additional 4\% to 10\% decrease in planned timber supply. Validation of the coarse filters used in this study (first three policy issues) was done using habitat requirements of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Almost all scenarios induced a disturbance rate likely to allow a self-sustaining woodland caribou population within 25 years.},

A forest remnants map was made using aerial photographs from 2006, and hydrographic and slope maps were used to PPA determination. Two scenarios were compared with landscape metrics: real (with current forest) and ideal ( current forest adding the PPA restoration). The results showed that 19\% of the city territory were classified as PPA, and from this area, only 45\% have forest cover. The preserved PPA represents 50\% of all forest cover in the landscape. Restoring the PPA would increase from 16.68\% to 28\% of forest cover landscape and enable the emergence of fragments larger than 3,000 ha. In the real scenario, the bigger fragments have 300 ha. The presence of forest remnants is closely related to PPA areas: riverbanks, floodplains and hillside, where urban occupation was hampered and there is legal protection. The situation shows that the PPA play a fundamental role in forest patches conservation in a largely urbanized city, where natural areas support pressure. The evaluation of the scenarios showed that the incorporation of the legal provisions in planning and territorial ordering subsides the strategies for the maintenance of natural habitats and, consequently the reduction of the negative effects on biodiversity. However, the recent changes in Forest Code may represent a retrocession in the environmental scenario against to the increasing urbanization.},

Here we show that, in scenarios using the low end of the CL range, N deposition exceeded critical loads over 0.38, 6.5, 13.1, 88.6, and 222.1 million ha for the Mediterranean California, North American Desert, Northwestern Forested Mountains, Great Plains, and Eastern Forest ecoregions, respectively, with corresponding species losses ranging from {\textless}1\% to 30\%. When we ran scenarios assuming ecosystems were less sensitive (using a common CL of 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and the high end of the CL range) minimal losses were estimated. The large range in projected impacts among scenarios implies uncertainty as to whether current critical loads provide protection to terrestrial plant biodiversity nationally and urge greater research in refining critical loads for U.S. ecosystems.},

Results are reported as the period of active management required for modelled scenarios of non-flushed and flushed sites for a range of pre-filling treatments. The base scenario against which results were evaluated was raw municipal solid waste (MSW) for which only cadmium failed to reach equilibrium. Flushed raw MSW met our criteria for stabilisation with active leachate management for 40 years, subject to each of the leachate species being present at or below their average UK concentrations. Stable non-reactive wastes, meeting EU waste acceptance criteria, fared badly in the non-flushed scenario, with only two species stabilising after a management period within 1000 years and the majority requiring {\textgreater} 2000 years of active leachate management. The flushing scenarios showed only a marginal improvement, with arsenic still persisting beyond 2000 years management even with an additional 500 mm y(-1) of infiltration. The stabilisation time for mechanically sorted organic residues (without flushing) was high, and even with flushing, arsenic and chromium appeared to remain a problem. Two mechanical biological treatment (MBT) scenarios were examined, with medium and high intensity composting. Both were subjected to the non-flushing and flushing scenarios. The non-flushing case of both options fell short of the basic requirements of achieving equilibrium within decades. The intense composting option with minimal flushing appeared to create a scenario where equilibrium could be achieved. For incinerator bottom ash (raw and subjected to various treatments), antimony, copper, chloride and sulphate were the main controls on achieving equilibrium, irrespective of treatment type. Flushing at higher flushing rates (500 mm y(-1)) failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the management period required.},

	abstract = {European mountains are particularly sensitive to climatic disruptions and land use changes. The latter leads to high rates of natural reforestation over the last 50 years. Faced with the challenge of predicting possible impacts on ecosystem services, LUCC models offer new opportunities for land managers to adapt or mitigate their strategies. Assessing the spatial uncertainty of future LUCC is crucial for the definition of sustainable land use strategies. However, the sources of uncertainty may differ, including the input parameters, the model itself, and the wide range of possible futures. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to assess the probability of occurrence of future LUCC that combines the inherent uncertainty of model parameterization and the ensemble uncertainty of the future based scenarios. For this purpose, we used the Land Change Modeler tool to simulate future LUCC on a study site located in the Pyrenees Mountains (France) and two scenarios illustrating two land use strategies. The model was parameterized with the same driving factors used for its calibration. The definition of ‘static vs. dynamic’ and ‘quantitative vs. qualitative (discretized)’ driving factors, and their combination resulted in four parameterizations. The combination of model outcomes produced maps of the spatial uncertainty of future LUCC. This work involves adapting the definition of spatial uncertainty in the literature to future-based LUCC studies. It goes beyond the uncertainty of simulation models by integrating the uncertainty of the future to provide maps to help decision makers and land managers.},

	abstract = {Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) is the dominant tree species in the Canadian province of Québec’s boreal ecosystem, particularly in the black spruce-feathermoss (BSFM) domain (between the 49th and the 52nd parallels). While black spruce is generally well adapted to regenerate after wildfires, regeneration failure can sometimes occur, resulting in the irreversible conversion of closed-crown BSFM to open black spruce-lichen woodlands (OW). With OWs representing approximately 7\% (1.6 M ha) of Québec’s BSFM domain, the afforestation of OWs carries significant theoretical potential for carbon (C) sequestration, which has not yet been evaluated. The main objectives of the study were then: (i) to estimate the theoretical C balance of OW afforestation within the closed-crown BSFM domain in Québec’s boreal forest; (ii) to calculate, using the life cycle analysis (LCA) method, all the GHG emissions related to black spruce OW afforestation in the closed-crown BSFM domain of Québec. The CO2FIX v. 3.1 model was used to calculate the biological C balance between the baseline (natural OW of site index 9 at age 50) and afforestation (black spruce plantation of site index 6 at age 25) scenarios, using the best estimates available for all five recommended C compartments (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, deadwood, and soil). The simulation revealed a biological C balance of 77.0 t C ha−1, 70 years following afforestation, for an average net sequestration rate of 1.1 t C ha−1 year−1. Biological C balance only turns positive after 27 years. When integrating the uncertainties related to both the plantation growth yield and the wildfire disturbance, the average sequestration rate varies between 0.2 and 1.9 t C ha−1 year−1. GHG emissions are 1.3 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 for all afforestation-related operations, which is less than 0.5\% of the biological C balance after 70 years. Thus, GHG emissions do not significantly affect the net C balance of the afforestation project simulated. Several recommendations are made, mostly centered on the factors influencing the growth rate of carbon stocks and the impact of natural disturbances, to minimize the range of uncertainties associated to the sequestration potential and maximize the mitigation benefits of an OW afforestation project.},

	abstract = {A large proportion of the world's biodiversity is reportedly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. However, there are few studies that investigate the interaction between these two threats using empirical data. Here, we investigate interactions between climate change and land-use change in the future distribution of 23 dominant tree species in mainland Spain. We simulated changes up to year 2100 using a climate-dependent Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model, parameterized with colonization and extinction events recorded in 46596 survey plots. We estimated that the distribution of 17 out of 23 tree species are expanding and hence not at equilibrium with the climate. However, climate change will make the future occupancy of 15 species to be lower than expected if climate, and habitat, remained stable (baseline scenario). Climate change, when combined with the loss of 20\% of the habitat, was estimated to reduce species occupancies (relative to baseline projections) by an average of 23\% if habitat loss was spatially clumped, and by 35\% if it was scattered. If habitat loss occurred in areas already impacted by human activities, species occupancies would be reduced by 26\%. Land-use changes leading to habitat gain (i.e. creation through reforestation) could slightly mitigate the effects of climate change, but a 20\% increment in habitat would reduce climate change-driven losses in species occupancies by only approximate to 3\%.Synthesis and applications. The distributions of the most common tree species in mainland Spain are expanding, but climate change threatens to reduce this expansion by approximate to 18\% for 15 of the 23 studied species. Moreover, if the habitat of these species is simultaneously lost, the occupancies of all of them will be reduced further, with variation depending on the spatial pattern of the lost habitats. However, we did not detect synergies between climate change and habitat loss. The combined effect (with 20\% habitat loss) was 5-13\% less than what it would be if the effects were additive. Importantly, reforestation could partially offset the negative effects of climate change, but complete mitigation would require an increase in forested land of approximate to 80\%, and the prioritization of territories that are less impacted by human activities.

forest carbon stocks dropped at time of harvest, but rose rapidly after 50 years to be almost
double that of the indigenous shrubland scenario. In both scenarios, the main environmental
benefit   was   a   large   50\%   sediment   yield   reduction   from   the   catchment.   As   most
afforestation occurred on sheep and beef hill country, where stock density is low, there was

provision of natural habitat was slightly lower for pine forest than for indigenous shrubland.

As for many fish populations over the world which are currently being heavily exploited or overfished, urgent management actions in the form of recovery plans are needed for restoring this stock to sustainable levels. Stochastic projections based on a statistical population model incorporating predation were conducted over a period of 30 years (2010-2040) to assess the expected outcomes of alternative fishing strategies on the stock recovery under different scenarios of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) abundance and environmental conditions. This sensitivity study shows that water temperature is key in the rebuilding of the NGSL cod stock. Model projections suggest that maintaining the current management practice under cooler water temperatures is likely to maintain the species in an endangered status. Under current or warmer conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, partial recovery might only be achieved by significant reductions in both fishing and predation pressure. In the medium-term, a management strategy that reduces catch could be favoured over a complete moratorium so as to minimize socio-economic impacts on the industry.},

Regression analysis suggested that salmon and dace densities were affected by water temperature (negative for salmon, positive for dace) and structural habitat factors (woody debris for salmon, pools for dace). Salmon density was higher in forest reaches than in grassland reaches, whereas dace density was higher in grassland reaches, suggesting that the removal of riparian forest had raised water temperature and allowed upstream invasions by dace. In contrast to salmon and dace, neither the density of leach nor sculpin differed between the forest and grassland reaches. For their densities, a negative effect of each on the other was most important, suggesting a strong effect of interspecific competition between leach and sculpin on their distributions. However, regression models also suggested that substrate heterogeneity mediated the outcome of their interspecific competition. On the basis of the results, a scenario is predicted for a fish-assemblage change with a typical land-development process in Hokkaido, and the importance of leaving or restoring riparian buffer for conservation and restoration of stream habitat is emphasized.},

	abstract = {QuestionsDo local plant-plant interactions and facilitation play an important role in vegetation dynamics after disturbance in the high tropical Andes? In particular, does the dominant shrub Baccharis prunifolia have an effect on microclimate and local vegetation structure within old-fields at the upper forest line? Does distance from the border of the surrounding forests also influence community structure within fallow plots? Is there an interaction between facilitation and edge effects on vegetation regeneration? LocationGavidia Valley, Sierra Nevada de Merida, Venezuela. MethodsPlant cover, species richness and community structure were compared in circular micro-plots placed under the canopy of B.prunifolia shrubs and in open areas (12 micro-plots in each case) both near and far from the forest border within two 10-12yr successional plots at 3400m a.s.l. (a total of 96 micro-plots). Additionally, topsoil temperature was monitored for 1mo in the four situations under study. ResultsAverage and maximum temperature and temperature amplitudes were lower under the canopy of B.prunifolia shrubs than in open areas; this effect being more marked far from the forest edge. Species richness, vegetation cover and the density of dominant forest trees were higher under the shrubs' canopy than in the inter-shrub spaces. The proximity to the edge of the surrounding forest also had a positive effect on species richness, with no significant interaction with the local sampling situation (under shrub vs outside). ConclusionsOur results suggest that both facilitation and edge effects influence the effectiveness of vegetation regeneration within old-fields in the high tropical Andes. Consequently, these processes should be considered for interpreting vegetation dynamics in environmental change scenarios at the tropical mountain tree line and for the design of ecological restoration strategies in these high-diversity ecotones, which have been subjected to large-scale anthropogenic transformations in recent decades.},

Data are analysed using two mechanisms-content and discourse analysis. It is shown that there is a high degree of reflective perceptions on issues of quality of life and the environment with a low level of concern about further use of peatlands as places of employment-a shift from a productive, utilitarian perception to a post-productive, non-utilitarian perception. It is also shown that. when presented with a scenario that sees cutaway peatlands being used for amenity and biodiversity. there are no negative issues and some degree of enthusiasm.

Comparisons are made in four independent study areas in western Pennsylvania and New York.

Results are similar across the four study areas, and are robust to variations in data collection and compilation methods. These results disagree with previous pollen-based estimates that suggested a greater relative influence of a 2X CO2 climate change, but do indicate that a 3.5X CO2 climate change may cause greater changes in forest composition than has already occurred due to anthropogenic impacts.},

This analysis confirmed the existence of extensive hybridization in the main river, resulting in an equal mixture of alleles belonging to marble trout, and Danubian and Atlantic brown trout (Salmo trutta). Despite the high level of introgression observed in the main Soca River, nearly pure populations of marble trout were found in the headwaters of five tributaries. The five stations with pure marble trout will be the basis of a rehabilitation programme. Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria were observed and hypotheses are discussed to explain this.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic features such as urbanization, roads, and power lines, are increasing in western United States landscapes in response to rapidly growing human populations. However, their spatial effects have not been evaluated. Our goal was to model the human footprint across the western United States. We. rst delineated the actual area occupied by anthropogenic features, the physical effect area. Next, we developed the human footprint model based on the ecological effect area, the zone in. uenced by features beyond their physical presence, by combining seven input models: three models quanti. ed top- down anthropogenic in. uences of synanthropic predators ( avian predators, domestic dog and cat presence risk), and four models quanti. ed bottom- up anthropogenic in. uences on habitat ( invasion of exotic plants, human- caused. res, energy extraction, and anthropogenic wildland fragmentation). Using independent bird population data, we found bird abundance of four synanthropic species to correlate positively with human footprint intensity and negatively for three of the six species in. uenced by habitat fragmentation. We then evaluated the extent of the human footprint in relation to terrestrial ( ecoregions) and aquatic systems ( major rivers and lakes), regional management and conservation status, physical environment, and temporal changes in human actions. The physical effect area of anthropogenic features covered 13\% of the western United States with agricultural land ( 9.8\%) being most dominant. High- intensity human footprint areas ( class 8 - 10) overlapped highly productive low- elevation private landholdings and covered 7\% of the western United States compared to 48\% for lowintensity areas ( class 1 - 3), which were con. ned to low- productivity high- elevation federal landholdings. Areas within 1 km of rivers were more affected by the human footprint compared to lakes. Percentage human population growth was higher in low- intensity human footprint areas. The disproportional regional effects of the human footprint on landscapes in the western United States create a challenge to management of ecosystems and wildlife populations. Using footprint models, managers can plan land use actions, develop restoration scenarios, and identify areas of high conservation value at local landscapes within a regional context. Moreover, human footprint models serve as a tool to stratify landscapes for studies investigating. oral and faunal response to human disturbance intensity gradients.},

	abstract = {This report describes a land management modeling effort that analyzed potential impacts of proposed actions under an updated Bureau of Land Management Resource Management Plan that will guide management for 20 years on 4.6 million hectares in the Great Basin ecoregion of the United States. State-and-transition models that included vegetation data, fire histories, and many parameters (i.e., rates of succession, fire return intervals, outcomes of management actions, and invasion rates of native and nonnative invasive species) were developed through workshops with scientific experts and range management specialists. Alternative restoration scenarios included continuation of current management, full fire suppression, wildfire use in designated fire use zones, wildfire use in resilient vegetation types only, restoration with a tenfold budget increase, no restoration treatments, and no livestock grazing. Under all the scenarios, cover of vegetation states with native perennial understory declined and was replaced by tree-invaded and weed-dominated states. The greatest differences among alternative management scenarios resulted from the use of fire as a tool to maintain native understory. Among restoration scenarios, only the scenario assuming a tenfold budget increase had a more desirable outcome than the current management scenario. Removal of livestock alone had little effect on vegetation resilience. Rather, active restoration was required. The predictive power of the model was limited by current understanding of Great Basin vegetation dynamics and data needs including statistically valid monitoring of restoration treatments, invasiveness and invasibility, and fire histories. The authors suggest that such computer models can be useful tools for systematic analysis of potential impacts in land use planning. However, for a modeling effort to be productive, the management situation must be conducive to open communication among land management agencies and partner entities, including nonprofit organizations.},

Fish, particularly the smallest species and individuals, aggregate in high numbers in the vegetation, and a strong predation pressure on zooplankton by shrimps and invertebrates, such as Chaoborus, can occur in these systems. We studied seasonal and diel changes in zooplankton and their potential predators (both fish and invertebrates) and physical and chemical characteristics among open water and vegetated habitats (emergent and submerged plants (SP)), in the subtropical Lake Blanca (34 degrees 54' S; 54 degrees 50' W), a shallow system with an extensive and complex littoral area and high abundance of vertebrate and invertebrate predators on zooplankton. We found differential horizontal distribution of some zooplankton species under the scenario of high abundance of small omnivorous-planktivorous fish and Chaoborus, especially in the seasons with intermediate catch per unit effort of fish. We found indications of a diel horizontal migration (DHM) opposite than described for temperate systems, as the two main cladocerans Bosmina longirostris and Diaphanosoma birgei were found in higher densities in the submerged plant beds during night, in spring and autumn respectively. Although we need experiments to prove DHM, Chaoborus seemed to be the main trigger of the apparent DHM, followed by small omnivorous fish. During summer no spatial differences were found likely because of high densities of fish in all habitats. In absence of piscivorous fish, the distribution of fish Jenynsia multidentata seemed to be conditioned by food availability and by predation risk of waterfowl. The refuge capacity of aquatic plants for zooplankton in subtropical systems seems weak and with consequent weak or no cascading effects on water transparency, as under very high fish and invertebrate densities (summer) the refuge for zooplankton was lost.},

We assume that a strong communication between scientific knowledge and stakeholders is needed to slow down and reverse the impacts of land degradation on drylands. With this purpose, we conducted an in-depth study at a national level in Spain. The work focused on a sample of published references on desertification in scientific journals indexed in the Web of Science (WoS). The keywords were related to desertification', drylands', land', soil', development' and Spain'. Multivariate analysis, bibliometric techniques and network analysis were used in order to (i) identify research categories and their temporal evolution throughout the period under consideration (1989-2012), (ii) determine if there were different approaches amongst different regions affected by desertification in Spain, (iii) establish the relationships between research categories, (iv) characterise types of co-authorship and (v) map out the Spanish network on the science of desertification. Erosion-soil degradation and soil analysis are the most important research categories, whereas climatic issues are subsidiary and quite isolated from the rest of topics. Very few articles consider desertification' as the main theme. Socio-economic issues have scant links with the core of biophysical science. The Spanish network on the science of desertification shows a low density. Moreover, the relationships between universities/research centres with other stakeholders are marginal. This is not the best scenario for transforming scientific knowledge into practical tools for policy makers and land users. Knowledge transfer should be a priority for national desertification programmes. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation within managed forests depends, in part, on management practices that restore or maintain plant community diversity and function. Because many plant communities are adapted to natural disturbances, gap-based management has potential to meet this need by using the historical range of variation in canopy disturbances to guide elements of harvest design. We tested this hypothesis with a well-replicated gap size experiment in a second-growth northern hardwood forest. We evaluated plant communities within and among experimental gaps of differing size, 13 years after an initial harvest. We used a resampling approach to estimate how conventional and gap-based management affect diversity partitioning and species and trait diversity of ground-layer plants. These diversity measures highlight relevant scales and function of ground-layer plants among harvest gap sizes and scenarios. Results from our field experiment showed that, at the gap-level, increasing gap size increased functional trait diversity of plants, while species diversity was higher in gaps than uncut references and maximized in medium-sized (20-30 m diameter) gaps. In harvest scenarios created by resampling our empirical data, we found that at the stand scale, increasing harvest intensity (larger gaps and greater proportion of forest in gaps) increased species richness and variability in initial bloom times, tolerance to shade, and number of life-forms in the plant community. Based on the measures of diversity and function used in our study, our results suggest that size of harvest-created gaps and proportion of forest in gaps can be manipulated to attain biodiversity goals but evaluating the regional species pool and seed sources (e.g., presence of invasives, rare species) will be important to maintain or restore conservation value.},

	abstract = {Aim The dimensions of species vulnerability to climate change are complex, and this impedes efforts to provide clear advice for conservation planning. In this study, we used a formal framework to assess species vulnerability to climate change quantifying exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then used this information to target areas for reducing vulnerability at a regional scale.
Location The 6500-km(2) Mount Lofty Ranges region in South Australia.
Methods We quantified the vulnerability of 171 plant species in a fragmented yet biologically important agro-ecological landscape, typical of many temperate zones globally. We specified exposure, using three climate change scenarios; sensitivity, as the adverse impact of climate change on species' spatial distribution; and adaptive capacity, as the ability of species to migrate calculated using dispersal kernels. Priority areas for reducing vulnerability were then identified by incorporating these various components into a single priority index.
Results Climate change had a variable impact on species distributions. Those species whose range decreased or shifted geographically were attributed higher sensitivity than those species that increased geographic range or remained unchanged. The ability to adapt to range changes in response to shifting climates varies both spatially and between species. Areas of highest priority for reducing vulnerability were found at higher altitudes and lower latitudes with increasing severity of climate change.
Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the use of a single spatially explicit index that identifies areas in the landscape for targeting specific conservation and restoration actions to reduce species vulnerability to climate change. Our index can be transferred to other regions around the world in which climate change poses an increasing threat to native species.},

	abstract = {Management of aquatic resources requires meaningful assessment endpoints on which to base decisions. In freshwater streams, assessment endpoints are often defined as fish communities. Given the limited resources available for environmental monitoring, having a means of predicting fish assemblages in streams where no sampling has yet occurred would be useful. Such a tool could be used for regional screening-level analyses of fish communities and could be input into local-scale model applications for evaluating management scenarios of stream degradation or restoration. In this study, a set of fish assemblages (a list of fish species and their corresponding relative abundances) representative of different stream types in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the United States was defined by use of a k-means cluster analysis performed on relative abundance estimates. The cluster analysis produced 18 fish assemblages, and the following 14 species had the greatest relative abundance in at least one of the 18 assemblages: eastern blacknose dace Rhinichthys atratulus, bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum, creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, fantail darter Etheostoma flabellare, mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii, mountain redbelly dace Phoxinus oreas, redbreast sunfish Lepomis auritus, rosyside dace Clinostomus funduloides, slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, striped shiner Luxilus chrysocephalus, and white sucker Catostomus commersonii. A discriminant analysis was then used to predict a stream's potential fish assemblage based on stream and watershed characteristics. The discriminant function had a 42\% success rate using the following predictors: latitude, longitude, mean stream depth, percent urban area of the watershed, and percent fine gravel on the stream bottom. The discriminant function was validated with an independent data set from a regional data collection effort in West Virginia, resulting in 44\% success when classifying observed stream fish communities.},

The purpose of the current study was to use hydrothermal germination models and a soil energy and water flux model to evaluate intra- and interannual variability in seedbed microclimate relative to potential germination response of six perennial grasses and cheatgrass. We used a 44-yr weather record to parameterize a seedbed microclimate model for estimation of hourly temperature and moisture at seeding depth for a sandy loam soil type at the Orchard Field Test Site in southwestern Ada County, Idaho. Hydrothermal germination response was measured in the laboratory for two seed lots of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), four seed lots of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] Love), three seed lots of bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf] Swezey), and one seed lot each of Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.), big squirreltail (Elymus multisetus [J.G. Smith] M.E. Jones), thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus [Scribn. And J.G. Smith] Gould) and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer). Germination response models were developed to estimate potential germination rate for 13 subpopulations of each seed lot for every hour of the 44-yr simulation. Seedbed microclimate was assessed seasonally and for each day, month, and year, and germination rate-sum estimates integrated for a numerical index of relative site favorability for germination for each time period. The rate-sum favorability index showed a consistent pattern among seed lots for different years, and provides a relatively sensitive indicator of annual and seasonal variability in seedbed microclimate. This index could be used with field data to define minimum weather thresholds for successful establishment of alternative plant materials, in conjunction with weather forecast models for making restoration and fire-rehabilitation management decisions in the fall season, for evaluation of potential climate-change impacts on plant community trajectories, and in optimization schemes for selecting among alternative restoration/rehabilitation management scenarios.},

	abstract = {To remain viable, populations must be resilient to both natural and human-caused environmental changes. We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures.},

Indigenous species have been grown since about 3500 BC. These crops are grown in diverse agro-climatic conditions ranging from north-eastern / north-western hills to down south under irrigated/rainfed, timely/late-sown, saline soils and mixed cropping. In India the research work on the improvement of rapeseed-mustard started by the turn of the 20(th) century at Pusa (Bihar), the then Bengal Presidency through the collection of land races and their purification. The scientific work for varietal improvement of Indian oleiferous Brassiceae started at Layallpur (now Faisalabad in Pakistan), then in Punjab of undivided India. This paper reviews the research and development in rapeseed-mustard breeding during the past 100 years in terms of organizational set up as well as major accomplishments in relation to genetic resource management, varietal development, quality improvement, hybrid development, improving tolerance to abiotic / biotic stresses, seed production and convergence of conventional and biotechnological approaches. Accomplishments in oilseeds Brassica improvement have been remarkable with the development of 203 agro-climatic specific varieties till 2010 including four hybrids, five low erucic, five low erucic and low glucosinolate varieties and registration of 42 genetic stocks. The paper also attempts to present future outlook and strategy for rapeseed-mustard research to enhance productivity and quality as well as stabilizing yield gains.},

	abstract = {Large-scale river diversions on the lower Mississippi River are considered to be an important component of wetland restoration efforts in coastal Louisiana. Diversions are used primarily for salinity control but increasingly proposed also as a major way to deliver sediments and nutrients to coastal wetlands impacted by the construction of flood control levees. We used a coupled hydrology-hydrodynamics model of the Barataria estuary, a site of the Davis Pond Diversion - the world's largest river diversion project, to examine salinity variations under different diversion discharge scenarios. Discharge scenarios were selected based on actual freshwater discharges in different years and management alternatives that included a scenario with several new diversions. The model results indicate that river diversions strongly affect salinities only in the middle section of the Barataria estuary. The upper parts of the estuary are fresh most of the time and so the excess fresh water from river diversions has only a minor impact on salinity in this region. Also, the Davis Pond diversion has little impact on salinities in the coastal section of the estuary because of strong marine influence in this area adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Interestingly, the predicted salinity differences between different model scenarios can be as high as 10 in some months and places. These differences can be biologically significant depending on the salinity tolerance of different species and could cause a shift in community composition within the affected region.

	abstract = {A considerable effort to rehabilitate and extend degraded irrigation schemes is taking place along the Mauritanian side in the Senegal River Valley. To increase understanding of the effects of these activities on the population, a model was used to analyse how the irrigated agriculture production interacts with other production systems, human food supply, and economic prosperity in a representative village in the Middle Valley. The activities in the village comprise grazing of mostly goats and sheep on shrubland, rain fed cropping, partly on saturated soil as river or plain floods recede, and an irrigation area of 32 ha soon to be enlarged to 90 ha. The production environment is characterized by a long dry winter, small, highly variable summer rainfall, and high temperatures and evaporative conditions. River flooding is variable and dependant on rainfall at great distance from the village. Using a generated weather series, the model evaluates the fodder supply for livestock on the shrubland, the productivity of grain and stubble for human and animal consumption, respectively, together with the human labour, and fertilizer and fuel requirements to maintain optional production scenarios. A financial sector calculates cash balance. Established cropping practice uses cowpea, sorghum, millet and rice, the latter on irrigated land. All families have equal access to grazing on the shrubland but different access to rain fed, flood land, and irrigation cropping. The model evaluates the impact of production scenarios on identified family types with distinct resources, extending current practice to a more diverse use of irrigated land by introducing alternative summer (sorghum) and new winter (cowpea) crops. The analysis of the current scenarios reveals the small and variable productivity of the shrubland, the precarious situation facing a family with access to rain-fed cropping only, and the stabilizing, although still inadequate, impact of the initial irrigation project. Expansion of the irrigation area, and more diversified cropping, will provide more families with access to irrigation but the small area available to each family (0.50 ha) will not produce sufficient grain or straw unless cropping is intensified to include a second winter crop. With that, additional benefits will flow indirectly to villagers without access to irrigation, through increased requirement for labour and sale of grain and fodder. The expanded irrigation area increases the stock carrying capacity of the village, raising concerns for the sustainable management of the shrubland. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is comparatively limited information in the humid tropics on the surface and sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity. K-* at 23 sites at four depths (0 m, n = 166), (0.10 m, n = 139),0.45-0.60 m, n = 117, (1.35-1.50 m. n = 117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7-10 years old, Tectona grandis, similar to 25-30 years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12 years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K-* were then linked with rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways.
The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K-* at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric Nitosols and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric Nitosols) and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K-* with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K-* but their K-* still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the 'memory' from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K-*, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K-* when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K-* during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the 'infiltration - trade-off' hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auricultformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) is likely to be the critical factor in affecting surface K-* over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern.

	abstract = {The strategic importance of ecosystem service valuation as an operational basis for policy decisions on natural restoration has been increasingly recognized in order to align the provision of ecosystem services with the expectation of human society. The contingent valuation method (CVM) is widely used to quantify various ecosystem services. However, two areas of concern arise: (1) whether people value specific functional ecosystem services and overlook some intrinsic aspects of natural restoration, and (2) whether people understand the temporal dimension of ecosystem services and payment schedules given in the contingent scenarios. Using a peri-urban riparian meadow restoration project in Flanders, Belgium as a case, we explored the impacts of residents' perceived importance of various ecosystem services and stated financial constraints on their willingness-to-pay for the proposed restoration project employing the CVM. The results indicated that people tended to value all the benefits of riparian ecosystem restoration concurrently, although they accorded different importances to each individual category of ecosystem services. A longer payment scheme can help the respondents to think more about the flow of ecosystem services into future generations. A weak temporal embedding effect can be detected, which might be attributed to respondents' concern about current financial constraints, rather than financial bindings associated with their income and perceived future financial constraints. This demonstrates the multidimensionality of respondents' financial concerns in CV. This study sheds light on refining future CV studies, especially with regard to public expectation of ecosystem services and the temporal dimension of ecosystem services and payment schedules.},

	abstract = {Ecological process models and empirical envelope models have been used to relate climatic-change predictions to effects on plant species and vegetation. Climatic-envelope models arf, useful for simultaneous investigation of many plant species whose range-limiting mechanisms are poorly known. They are most effectively applied in regions with strong temperature and moisture gradients and low relief. Their required databases are often relatively easy to obtain. We provide an example involving the effect of six annual warming scenarios, ranging from +1 degreesC to +2 degreesC and from +10\% to -20\% annual precipitation (some have greater warming in winter than in summer), on 117 native woody species in Florida (U.S.A.). Tree species at their southern range boundaries in several parts of Florida are likely to be negatively affected by as little as 1 degreesC warming if it is greater in winter than in summer or is accompanied by a 20\% decrease in annual precipitation. Potential species responses to an identical type of 1 degreesC warming may be different for some conservation areas in the same region of Florida. Potentially extensive disruption of some major woody ecosystems is predicted tinder certain types of 1 degreesC annual warming and under all types of 2 degreesC annual warming that were investigated. Additional consideration of nonclimatic factors suggests that many Potential effects on species and ecosystems are not underestimates of actual effects over a 100-year period of warming. Me recommend monitoring for decreased fertility and viability of ecologically important, temperate woody species near their southern range limits in Florida. Early detection of such changes in fitness might then provide the for mitigations designed to alleviate more serious subsequent effects on biodiversity. Control of invasive, non-native plant species and prevention of their additional introduction, human-assisted translocation of native subtropical plant species into previously temperate Parts of Florida, and restoration of more natural hydrological regimes are examples of potentially useful mitigations if climatic warming continues.},

The temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a and transparency as Secchi depth measurements are studied in the Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom, The Netherlands, with a comprehensive structural dynamic model. In the formulation of the biological model, phytoplankton as several species, zooplankton, detritus, planktivores and benthivores, and piscivores are considered to be major contributing state variables for the model. The primary goal of this paper is to describe the possible impacts of several environmental scenarios on chlorophyll-a biomass qualitatively as it would help lake and environmental managers and relevant authorities elucidate the processes of eutrophication and biomanipulation in a broad way. Some of the scenarios that have been studied by this model are: (1) The effect of fixed stoichiometry in terms of internal nitrogen and phosphorus that are tied up within algal cells; (2) the effects of external phosphorus limitation; (3) light limitation and external nitrogen limitation on algal growth; (4) probable consequences that have taken place within the chlorophyll-a biomass due to change in biomasses of various aquatic organisms; and (5) possible changes of chlorophyll-a biomass due to higher temperatures caused by global warming.},

	abstract = {Projected climate change at a regional level is expected to shift vegetation habitat distributions over the next century. For the sub-alpine species whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), warming temperatures may indirectly result in loss of suitable bioclimatic habitat, reducing its distribution within its historic range. This research focuses on understanding the patterns of spatiotemporal variability for future projected P. albicaulis suitable habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) through a bioclimatic envelope approach. Since intermodel variability from General Circulation Models (GCMs) lead to differing predictions regarding the magnitude and direction of modeled suitable habitat area, nine bias-corrected statistically down-scaled GCMs were utilized to understand the uncertainty associated with modeled projections. P. albicaulis was modeled using a Random Forests algorithm for the 1980-2010 climate period and showed strong presence/absence separations by summer maximum temperatures and springtime snowpack. Patterns of projected habitat change by the end of the century suggested a constant decrease in suitable climate area from the 2010 baseline for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 4.5 climate forcing scenarios. Percent suitable climate area estimates ranged from 2-29\% and 0.04-10\% by 2099 for RCP 8.5 and 4.5 respectively. Habitat projections between GCMs displayed a decrease of variability over the 2010-2099 time period related to consistent warming above the 1910-2010 temperature normal after 2070 for all GCMs. A decreasing pattern of projected P. albicaulis suitable habitat area change was consistent across GCMs, despite strong differences in magnitude. Future ecological research in species distribution modeling should consider a full suite of GCM projections in the analysis to reduce extreme range contractions/expansions predictions. The results suggest that restoration strageties such as planting of seedlings and controlling competing vegetation may be necessary to maintain P. albicaulis in the GYA under the more extreme future climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {This study provides one historical and two alternative future contexts for evaluating land cover modifications within the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) floodplain. Given previously documented changes in land use, river engineering, restoration efforts and hydro-climatic changes within the UMR basin and floodplain, we wanted to know which of these changes are the most important determinants of current and projected future floodplain land cover. We used Geographic Information System data covering approximately 37\% of the UMR floodplain (3232km2) for ca 1890 (pre-lock and dam) and three contemporary periods (1975, 1989 and 2000) across which river restoration actions have increased and hydro-climatic changes have occurred. We further developed two 50-year future scenarios from the spatially dependent land cover transitions that occurred from 1975 to 1989 (scenario A) and from 1989 to 2000 (scenario B) using Markov models. Land cover composition of the UMR did not change significantly from 1975 to 2000, indicating that current land cover continues to reflect historical modifications that support agricultural production and commercial navigation despite some floodplain restoration efforts and variation in river discharge. Projected future land cover composition based on scenario A was not significantly different from the land cover for 1975, 1989 or 2000 but was different from the land cover of scenario B, which was also different from all other periods. Scenario B forecasts transition of some forest and marsh habitat to open water by the year 2050 for some portions of the northern river and projects that some agricultural lands will transition to open water in the southern portion of the river. Future floodplain management and restoration planning efforts in the UMR should consider the potential consequences of continued shifts in hydro-climatic conditions that may occur as a result of climate change and the potential effects on floodplain land cover.

	abstract = {The benthic community was analyzed to evaluate pollution-induced changes for the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated site at Hunters Point (HP) relative to 30 reference sites in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. An analysis based on functional traits of feeding, reproduction, and position in the sediment shows that HP is depauperate in deposit feeders, subsurface carnivores, and species with no protective barrier. Sediment chemistry analysis shows that PCBs are the major risk drivers at HP (1,570 ppb) and that the reference sites contain very low levels of PCB contamination (9 ppb). Different feeding traits support the existence of direct pathways of exposure, which can be mechanistically linked to PCB bioaccumulation by biodynamic modeling. The model shows that the deposit feeder Neanthes arenaceodentata accumulates approximately 20 times more PCBs in its lipids than the facultative deposit feeder Macoma balthica and up to 130 times more than the filter feeder Mytilus edulis. The comparison of different exposure scenarios suggests that PCB tissue concentrations at HP are two orders of magnitude higher than at the reference sites. At full scale, in situ sorbent amendment with activated carbon may reduce PCB bioaccumulation at HP by up to 85 to 90\% under favorable field and treatment conditions. The modeling framework further demonstrates that such expected remedial success corresponds to exposure conditions suggested as the cleanup goal for HP. However, concentrations remain slightly higher than at the reference sites. The present study demonstrates how the remedial success of a sorbent amendment, which lowers the PCB availability, can be compared to reference conditions and traditional cleanup goals, which are commonly based on bulk sediment concentrations.},

	abstract = {As a result of the liberalisation of the agricultural market, mountain regions in Central Europe are at great risk of experiencing increasing land abandonment and spontaneous reforestation. Prior to taking measures for landscape maintenance, the ecological and landscape-aesthetic consequences of land abandonment should be analysed. This paper addresses the aesthetic component of such analyses: we investigated whether lay people perceive land abandonment and spontaneous reforestation as a loss or a gain and developed a prototypical technique for rapid aesthetic assessment of reforestation scenarios for vast regions. First, we conducted image experiments to assess the respondents' reactions to increasing levels of reforestation. Based on these experiments we concluded that a medium degree of reforestation is most desirable. Second, we analysed the relationship between scenic beauty and landscape patterns and found that landscape preference values correlate significantly with various quantitative measures of the landscape pattern (e,g., diversity and contagion indices of grey-tone and colour images). Third, we applied a GIS-assisted 'moving-window' technique to transform spatially explicit remote-sensing data (in particular orthophotos) of a test region to spatially explicit data of landscape-pattern indices. Thanks to the significant positive correlation between pattern indices and landscape preference values, the resulting maps can preliminarily be interpreted as 'beauty'-maps of the test-region.},

However, communities change and these changes are likely to affect how well an agency meets its environmental justice mandate over the long term. In this research, an agent-based model is introduced to simulate how alternative environmental remediation scenarios may affect environmental justice outcomes in a dynamic residential environment with two demographic classes with preferences for living in proximity to neighbors similar to themselves. Under these circumstances, there is unlikely to be one best strategy to achieve both environmental improvement and environmental equity, and a focus on valuable land is the least effective over the long run.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the potential of stock enhancement for decapod crustaceans, we analyzed stock enhancement programs for 4 species: the penaeid prawns (Penaeus japonicus) in Japan and (Penaeus chinensis) China, the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) in Norway, and the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) in Japan, for which stocking effectiveness has been intensively examined. For each species, we summarized the life cycle, fishery, and stocking programs and then comparatively analyzed the recapture rates, the yield from the released individuals (YPR), and the economic efficiency. Scylla paramamosain had some advantages in stock enhancement, including restricted living areas such as bays and estuaries, a large body size, and high values of the ratio of price per landed individual to the cost per released juvenile. These characteristics promised higher values of YPR and economic efficiency, even at lower recapture rates. Therefore, hatchery releases affect areas with small stocks of S. paramamosain. This scenario might also be inferred for H. gammarus, which had the highest YPR and does not generally migrate from the release site, although the economic efficiency was low due to the high cost of juvenile production. On the other hand, fishery productions of the penaeid prawns, which had a lower YPR, could not be augmented without a huge number of released juveniles and the maintenance of nursery habitats. The restocking is a more cost-effective measure for sustainable fishery production than only a sea ranching (put and take) operation. Therefore, hatchery releases for decapod crustaceans should be applied to rebuild wild stocks (restocking) with appropriate fishing regulations and habitat restoration. In the future, selection of target species for stock enhancement programs should take into account the necessity for restocking and their life history characteristics.},

	abstract = {In order to explore the impact of land-use change on carbon (C) stocks in South West England, three scenarios were explored based on current UK national- and regional-scale policies and plans. The scenarios assessed were: (i) Rebuilding Biodiversity (RB), involving habitat restoration of 824,244 ha of strategic nature areas; (ii) Forest Strategy (FS), involving establishment of 16,000 ha of new woodlands; and (iii) Biomass Strategy (BS), involving conversion of 65,513 ha of arable land into bioenergy crops. It was assumed that each of these targets would be implemented by the year 2020, with carbon build-up times of 100, 100 and 30 years, respectively. Estimates of C-stock changes were produced by compiling vegetation and soil organic C-density data for 11 land-use types from a systematic literature review. Results indicated that FS would lead to the highest yearly potential carbon sequestration (up to 3.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, the total C-stocks would be the highest under RB (up to 20\% increase), owing to the greater area of pastures and arable land being converted into broadleaved forest when compared to FS. BS would have the least effect on C (C-stock increase of up to 0.3\% and up to 0.41 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) sequestered). The spatially explicit analytical approach adopted here provides an indication of which land-use changes would contribute most to C-sequestration within the South West region, and could contribute to achieving national emission reduction targets post-2012.

Joint models of fishing participation and site choice were developed for two resident populations of anglers from northern Ontario. For both populations, the three innovations provided significant improvements to the models and important information for understanding and predicting recreational fishing behaviors. The utility of the model to fisheries managers was illustrated through a management scenario that involved the restoration of walleyes Sander vitreus in a large water body. The forecasts suggested that the effect of this restoration on fishing effort at other waters was influenced by spatial proximity and temporal use at the fishing sites.},

Is it possible to model the Ellenberg moisture value (mF) using variables representing site moisture conditions? Does mF help predict changes in vegetation composition and thus help in validating restoration success?
Location: Danube floodplain, Neuburg a. d. Donau, Bavaria, Germany.
Methods: A Generalized additive model (GAM) and a generalized linear model (GLM) were used for spatial prediction of mF using groundwater, relief and soil variables as predictors. Vegetation response to a changed hydrological regime was tested through replacing the old groundwater model with a new model representing the new water regime. With the help of a GIS, a spatial distribution and a scenario map of mF was produced. Model validation was done by cross-validation and comparison between predicted and observed data from repeated vegetation sampling on permanent plots.
Results: Groundwater level (minima of 2009) and soil thickness entered the final model as significant predictors of mF. The GAM of mF showed good predictive power, with more than 57\% of deviance explained. The corresponding GLM had slightly lower accuracy, with 51\% of deviance explained. Using the new groundwater model (minima of 2011) it was possible to forecast mF after restoration. Changes in mF are to be expected in areas directly affected by restoration measures. The model validation has proven that the quality of model prediction is good and represents the reality fairly well.
Conclusions: The study has shown that mF is a useful indicator for a summary prediction of ecological change. It can be expected that restoration will turn overall conditions wetter, and vegetation will respond to these changes with an increase of wetland plant species. With the help of the model, it is possible to measure the success of the restoration project. It is demonstrated that GAM can be used for intensive data exploration, after which a less complex and easily computable GLM can be parameterized.},

	abstract = {Human impact on the coastal zone is mainly exerted through riverine nutrient delivery, dependent on land use and management of the watershed. The link between human activity and coastal eutrophication is not direct, however, because of the complexity of the processes involved in the retention or elimination of nutrients during their transfer along the aquatic continuum from land to sea. In order to explore this link, we make use of 2 idealized models respectively representing the ecological functioning of whole drainage networks including their stagnants annexes (the Riverstrahler model) and of river impacted coastal systems (the Zoco model). Coupling of these 2 models, which use exactly the same kinetic formulation for all microbiological processes with only slightly different parameter values, allows simulation of the major trends of the seasonal variations of coastal algal blooms in response to changes in land use in the watershed. The models were applied to a hypothetical river-coastal zone system (the 'Phison River' and its plume in 'Eden Bight'), for a chronological succession of land use and management scenarios, ranging from the pristine forested watershed to the dense urbanization conditions of Western European industrialized countries. The results show that, as early as the beginning of the 19th century, development of intense blooms of non-diatoms, accompanied by a shift from phosphorus Limitation to silica/nitrogen limitation, might have occurred in the coastal zone. In the second half of the 20th century, increased use of nitrogen fertilizers, coming after the suppression of wetlands and buffer strips along rivers, might have again pushed the coastal system to phosphorus limitation, while the introduction of phosphorus-containing washing powders (from the mid 1960s) again reversed this trend. Under the chosen conditions of land use and population density, it was found that elimination of nitrogen from wastewater through generalized. tertiary treatment would not produce very significant changes in the eutrophication status of the coastal zone. On the other hand, phosphorus removal from point sources, preferably combined with wetlands restoration, would lead to a drastic reduction of algal blooms with a new shift to phosphorus Limitation.},

The niche models showed that P. orientalis has suitable habitat of ca. 4.2x106 km2 across most of eastern China and identified annual temperature, monthly minimum and maximum ultraviolet-B radiation and wet-day frequency as the critical factors shaping habitat availability for P. orientalis. Under the low concentration greenhouse gas emissions scenario, the range of the species may increase as global warming intensifies; however, under the higher concentrations of emissions scenario, we predicted a slight expansion followed by contraction in distribution. Overall, the range shift to higher latitudes and elevations would become gradually more significant.

This paper presents a model linking wading bird foraging numbers to hydrologic conditions in the ENP. Seasonal hydrologic statistics derived from a single water level recorder are well correlated with water depths throughout most areas of the ENP, and are effective as predictors of wading bird numbers when using a nonlinear hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the conditional distribution of bird populations. Model parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. Parameter and model uncertainty is assessed as a byproduct of the estimation process. Water depths at the beginning of the nesting season, the average dry season water level, and the numbers of reversals from the dry season recession are identified as significant predictors, consistent with the hydrologic conditions considered important in the production and concentration of prey organisms in this system. Long-term hydrologic records at the index location allow for a retrospective analysis (1952-2006) of foraging bird numbers showing low frequency oscillations in response to decadal fluctuations in hydroclimatic conditions. Simulations of water levels at the index location used in the Bayesian model under alternative water management scenarios allow the posterior probability distributions of the number of foraging birds to be compared, thus providing a mechanism for linking management schemes to seasonal rainfall forecasts.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is a key driver of riparian condition on dryland rivers but is in high demand for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses. Approaches are needed to guide decisions that balance human water needs while conserving riparian ecosystems. We developed a space-for-time substitution model that links groundwater change scenarios implemented within a Decision Support System (DSS) with proportions of floodplain vegetation types and abundances of breeding and migratory birds along the upper San Pedro River, AZ, USA. We investigated nine scenarios ranging from groundwater depletion to recharge. In groundwater decline scenarios, relative proportions of tall-canopied obligate phreatophytes (Populus/Salix, cottonwood/willow) on the floodplain progressively decline, and shrubbier species less dependent on permanent water sources (e. g. Tamarix spp., saltcedar) increase. These scenarios result in broad shifts in the composition of the breeding bird community, with canopy-nesting and water-obligate birds declining but midstory nesting birds increasing in abundance as groundwater declines. For the most extreme draw-down scenario where all reaches undergo groundwater declines, models project that only 10\% of the upper San Pedro floodplain would be comprised of cottonwood/willow (73\% saltcedar and 18\% mesquite), and abundances of canopy-nesting, water-obligate, and spring migrant birds would decline 48\%, 72\%, and 40\%, respectively. Groundwater recharge scenarios were associated with increases in canopy-nesting birds particularly given the extreme recharge scenario (all reaches regain shallow water tables and perennial streamflow). Model outputs serve to assess the sensitivity of biotic groups to potential changes in groundwater and thus to rank scenarios based on their expected ecological impacts.

	abstract = {Land managers have long identified a critical need for a practical and effective framework for designing restoration strategies, especially where invasive plants dominate. A holistic, ecologically based, invasive plant management (EBIPM) framework that integrates ecosystem health assessment, knowledge of ecological processes, and adaptive management into a successional management model has recently been proposed. However, well-defined principles that link ecological processes that need to be repaired to tools and strategies available to managers have been slow to emerge, thus greatly limiting the ability of managers to easily apply EBIPM across a range of restoration scenarios. The broad objective of this article is to synthesize current knowledge of the mechanisms and processes that drive plant community succession into ecological principles for EBIPM. Using the core concepts of successional management that identify site availability, species availability, and species performance as three general drivers of plant community change, we detail key principles that link management tools used in EBIPM to the ecological processes predicted to influence the three general causes of succession. Although we acknowledge that identification of principles in ecology has greatly lagged behind other fields and recognize that identification of ecological principles and the conditions in which they hold are still being developed, we demonstrate how current knowledge and future advances can be used to structure a holistic EBIPM framework that can be applied across a range of restoration scenarios.},

	abstract = {For more than a century, coastal wetlands have been recognized for their ability to stabilize shorelines and protect coastal communities. However, this paradigm has recently been called into question by small-scale experimental evidence. Here, we conduct a literature review and a small meta-analysis of wave attenuation data, and we find overwhelming evidence in support of established theory. Our review suggests that mangrove and salt marsh vegetation afford context-dependent protection from erosion, storm surge, and potentially small tsunami waves. In biophysical models, field tests, and natural experiments, the presence of wetlands reduces wave heights, property damage, and human deaths. Meta-analysis of wave attenuation by vegetated and unvegetated wetland sites highlights the critical role of vegetation in attenuating waves. Although we find coastal wetland vegetation to be an effective shoreline buffer, wetlands cannot protect shorelines in all locations or scenarios; indeed large-scale regional erosion, river meandering, and large tsunami waves and storm surges can overwhelm the attenuation effect of vegetation. However, due to a nonlinear relationship between wave attenuation and wetland size, even small wetlands afford substantial protection from waves. Combining man-made structures with wetlands in ways that mimic nature is likely to increase coastal protection. Oyster domes, for example, can be used in combination with natural wetlands to protect shorelines and restore critical fishery habitat. Finally, coastal wetland vegetation modifies shorelines in ways (e.g. peat accretion) that increase shoreline integrity over long timescales and thus provides a lasting coastal adaptation measure that can protect shorelines against accelerated sea level rise and more frequent storm inundation. We conclude that the shoreline protection paradigm still stands, but that gaps remain in our knowledge about the mechanistic and context-dependent aspects of shoreline protection.},

	abstract = {As demands for freshwater withdrawals continue to escalate in water-stressed regions, negative consequences of alterations to natural systems will become ever more severe. Habitat restoration projects may mitigate some of these challenges, but new strategies will be needed to maintain or enhance ecosystem health while simultaneously meeting human needs. Recycled water is a reliable water source that can be used both directly and indirectly to renew degraded urban stream ecosystems. In this review, aspects of hydrology, water quality, and ecosystem services in relation to water reuse for urban stream renewal are evaluated to identify research needs and design considerations for new systems. Use of recycled water for streamflow augmentation in urban areas remains largely unexplored scientifically, despite its potential widespread applications among water and wastewater utilities. To move this innovative concept toward implementation, experimental studies in stream microcosms are needed to examine ecological response to coupled modification of both hydrology and water quality. Appropriate methods for selecting potential sites for urban stream renewal should be identified, along with ecological and economic metrics for evaluating success. Examples of projects in California, Japan, Israel, and Spain are used to identify different management scenarios. However, design criteria from both successful and unsuccessful case studies require additional review and synthesis to develop robust guidelines for recycled water use in urban stream renewal. Motivations for past stream renewal projects include regulatory requirements for water quality improvement and endangered species protection, although these motivations alone may not be enough to facilitate widespread adoption of reusing wastewater for ecosystem enhancement. Consequently, future project designs should include more detailed ecosystem service valuations to describe broader societal benefits and attract the attention of government agencies and private organizations that ultimately make the choice between environmental perturbation or enhancement.},

	abstract = {Scenario planning should be an effective tool for developing responses to climate change but will depend on ecological assessments of broad enough scope to support decision-making. Using climate projections from an ensemble of 16 models, we conducted an assessment of a midcontinental area of North America (Minnesota) based on a resistance, resilience, and facilitation framework. We assessed likely impacts and proposed options for eight landscape regions within the planning area. Climate change projections suggest that by 2069, average annual temperatures will increase 3 degrees C with a slight increase in precipitation (6\%). Analogous climate locales currently prevail 400-500 km SSW. Although the effects of climate change may be resisted through intensive management of invasive species, herbivores, and disturbance regimes, conservation practices need to shift to facilitation and resilience. Key resilience actions include providing buffers for small reserves, expanding reserves that lack adequate environmental heterogeneity, prioritizing protection of likely climate refuges, and managing forests for multi-species and multi-aged stands. Modifying restoration practices to rely on seeding (not plants), enlarge seed zones, and include common species from nearby southerly or drier locales is a logical low-risk facilitation strategy. Monitoring "trailing edge" populations of rare species should be a high conservation priority to support decision-making related to assisted colonization. Ecological assessments that consider resistance, resilience, and facilitation actions during scenario planning is a productive first step towards effective climate change planning for biodiversity with broad applicability to many regions of the world.

	abstract = {1. A vast scientific literature has been devoted to identifying the best way to represent biodiversity for conservation in the last decade. Methods exist for deciding how to use scarce information and avoid omission and commission errors. The effect of these errors on reserve efficiency does not arise only from the accuracy of data representing conservation features, as usually considered. There are also several underlying assumptions associated with the type of data used that might affect accuracy of conservation decision-making and compromise achievement of conservation objectives.
2. Here the effects of two management scenarios on selection of priority areas for conservation are explored. The spatial distribution of 10 native freshwater fish species in an Iberian basin under present-day and reference conditions were modelled and priority areas for both scenarios using the same spatial and cost constraints were identified.
3. Priority areas identified under the present-day scenario reflected the up-to-date spatial distribution of species and avoided the selection of highly perturbed and costly areas. The isolated spatial distribution of native populations imposed by the current perturbation status limited the spatial connectivity between priority areas under the present-day scenario. Most importantly for the achievement of conservation objectives, priority areas selected under both scenarios did not overlap.
4. Given that the reference scenario was based on potential presence of native species the actual representation of species would be overestimated if consideration were not given to restoring reference conditions (high commission errors). Based on results obtained it is recommended that planners give more consideration to the current perturbation status when identifying priority areas for conservation.

	abstract = {Restoring missing ecological interactions by reintroducing locally extinct species or ecological surrogates for extinct species has been mooted as an approach to restore ecosystems. Australia's apex predator, the dingo, is subject to culling in order to prevent attacks on livestock. Dingo culling has been linked to ecological cascades evidenced by irruptions of herbivores and introduced mesopredators and declines of small and medium sized mammals. Maintenance of dingo populations is untenable for land-managers in many parts of Australia owing to their depredations on livestock. However, it may be possible to fill the apex predator niche with the Tasmanian devil which has less impact on livestock Devils once occurred throughout Australia, but became extinct from the mainland about 3000 years ago, but are now threatened by a disease epidemic in Tasmania. To explore the feasibility of reintroducing devils to mainland Australia we used species distribution models (SDMs) to determine if suitable climatic conditions for devils exist and fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) to predict the effects of devil reintroduction. Based on devils' current distribution, our SDM indicates that suitable areas for devils exist in south-eastern Australia. Our FCM examined ecosystem responses to predator-management scenarios by manipulating the abundances of devils, dingoes and foxes. Our FCMs showed devils would have cascading effects similar to, but weaker than those of dingoes. Devil introduction was linked to lower abundances of introduced mesopredators and herbivores. Abundances of small and medium sized mammals and understorey vegetation complexity increased with devil introduction. However, threatened species vulnerable to fox predation benefited little from devil introduction. Our study suggests that reintroducing ecological surrogates for apex predators may yield benefits for biodiversity conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This model incorporates the effects of habitat availability and location, density dependence, site fidelity, and stochasticity in survival and fecundity. River bank habitat patches suitable for this species were delineated using a geographic information systems (GIS) model of river bank height and were used in a PVA scenario analysis to assess the effects of habitat restoration that could occur by removing bank erosion control projects (bank revetment) on population viability Sensitivity analysis showed that the model estimated probability of quasi-extinction (dropping below 2000 breeding pairs) ranged from 0 to 08 depending on the Input parameters, with juvenile survival causing the greatest variability. However, comparing changes to the probability of quasi-extinction between the restored habitat scenario and current conditions showed a consistent 40-60\% decrease in probability of quasi-extinction across all parameter combinations The results of this research reaffirm the need for continued protection of the bank swallow as a listed species indicate that the removal of bank erosion control projects would increase viability of this population (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Reclamation for aspen revegetation in the Athabasca oil sands: Understanding soil water dynamics through unsaturated flow modelling. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 103-116. Reclamation of mined areas in the Athabasca oil sands region is required by law, with the ultimate goal of revegetating to species characteristic of predisturbance native plant communities. To develop adequate reclamation strategies, an analysis of soil water dynamics is of utmost importance, as is understanding the impact of the thickness of the reclamation cover. In this work, soil water dynamics and fluxes at the water table were simulated for three reclamation scenarios and compared with the fluxes obtained for natural conditions assuming that aspen is the target reclamation species. According to the simulations, a reclamation thickness between 0.5 and 1.0 m can be used to provide water for revegetation. The numerical simulations show that the reclaimed landscapes have fluxes at the water table that exhibit less fluctuation than natural conditions. To limit the interaction between the water table and atmospheric fluxes, and to limit upward flux, the water table should be deeper than 2.0 m on reclaimed landscapes that use aspen for revegetation, particularly when reclamation takes place during a dry climatological cycle.},

Recently, a market-based incentive program for the federally endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia) was implemented on a trial basis at Fort Hood, an Army training post in Texas, USA. Under this program, recovery credits accumulated by Fort Hood through contracts with private landowners are used to offset unintentional loss of breeding habitat of Golden-cheeked Warblers within the installation. Critical to successful implementation of such programs is the ability to value, in terms of changes to overall species viability, both habitat loss and habitat restoration or protection. In this study, we sought to answer two fundamental questions: Given the same amount of change in breeding habitat, does the change in some patches have a greater effect on metapopulation persistence than others? And if so, can characteristics of a patch (e.g., size or spatial location) be used to predict how the metapopulation will respond to these changes? To answer these questions, we describe an approach for using sensitivity analysis of a metapopulation projection model to predict how changes to specific habitat patches would affect species viability. We used a stochastic, discrete-time projection model based on stage-specific estimates of survival and fecundity, as well as various assumptions about dispersal among populations. To assess a particular patch's leverage, we quantified how much metapopulation viability was expected to change in response to changing the size of that patch. We then related original patch size and distance from the largest patch to each patch's leverage to determine if general patch characteristics could be used to develop guidelines for valuing changes to patches within a metapopulation. We found that both the characteristic that best predicted patch leverage and the magnitude of the relationship changed under different model scenarios. Thus, we were unable to find a consistent set of relationships, and therefore we emphasize the dangers in relying on general guidelines to assess patch value. Instead, we provide an approach that can be used to quantitatively evaluate patch value and identify critical needs for future research.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework and methodology to assist with optimising the outcomes of river rehabilitation in terms of delivery of multiple ecosystem services and the benefits they represent for humans at the river network scale. The approach is applicable globally, but was initially devised in the context of a project critically examining opportunities and constraints on delivery of river rehabilitation in Scotland. The spatial-temporal approach highlighted is river rehabilitation measure, rehabilitation scale, location on the stream network, ecosystem service and timescale specific and could be used as initial scoping in the process of planning rehabilitation at the river network scale. The levels of service delivered are based on an expert-derived scoring system based on understanding how the rehabilitation measure assists in reinstating important geomorphological, hydrological and ecological processes and hence intermediate or primary ecosystem function. The framework permits a "total long-term ({\textgreater}25 years) ecosystem service score" to be calculated which is the cumulative result of the combined effect of the number of and level of ecosystem services delivered over time. Trajectories over time for attaining the long-term ecosystem service score for each river rehabilitation measures are also given. Scores could also be weighted according to societal values and economic valuation. These scores could assist decision making in relation to river rehabilitation at the catchment scale in terms of directing resources towards alternative scenarios. A case study is presented of applying the methodology to the Eddleston Water in Scotland using proposed river rehabilitation options for the catchment to demonstrate the value of the approach. Our overall assertion is that unless sound conceptual frameworks are developed that permit the river network scale ecosystem services of river rehabilitation to be evaluated as part of the process of river basin planning and management, the total benefit of river rehabilitation may well be reduced. River rehabilitation together with a 'vision' and framework within which it can be developed, is fundamental to future success in river basin management.},

Soils and their functions may be impacted by these extreme events through changes in the biomass, composition and activities of edaphic microbial communities. We designed an experiment to investigate changes over time in the microbial biomass, composition (EL-FAME profiles) and functions (catabolic responses) after severe drought and high temperature disturbances. Impacts were assessed using indoor soil microcosms under controlled drought and high temperatures, mimicking various stress scenarios and durations in conditions of severe drought and heat wave. Drought and heat wave restructured the soil microbial communities over the course of the experiment. This may be a consequence of inhibition and/or killing of sensitive species and selection of tolerant species by the disturbances applied, but also of the proliferation of fast-growing species after environmental soil conditions had been restored. Heating dry soil at 50 C had a stronger effect than only drying. Moreover, above a critical threshold of heat wave duration, soil microbial communities may have undergone a drastic biomass killing and restructuring associated with a shift in physiological traits. In this experimental context, resilience of microbial catabolic functions was not observed and in consequence ecosystem processes such as carbon mineralization and sequestration in soil may be affected.

Formulation of revegetation strategies that provide site stabilization, resistance to further saltcedar and secondary weed infestation, and acceptable habitat values for affected wildlife species becomes particularly problematic in monotypic saltcedar stands under biological, fire, and herbicidal (that is, nonmechanical) control scenarios. Amount and density of standing biomass (live and dead) remaining after control pose limitations in relation to seeding and outplanting techniques, seed interception in aerial (broadcast) applications, and seedbed preparation methods. Undisturbed soil surfaces impacted by saltcedar leaf litter accumulation, salinity, hummocky micro relief, and nutrient limitations restrict potential for successful revegetation. Long duration of saltcedar occupation may deplete desirable microbial communities, particularly arbuscular(endo)mycorrhizae symbiotic and host-specific to native revegetation species. Selected results of innovative revegetation strategies at study sites on the Rio Grande and the Colorado River are discussed. Technical approaches include: 1) soil surface and rhizosphere manipulation methods to facilitate removal of standing dead biomass, increase precipitation capture, improve soil moisture retention, and create microsites exhibiting lower salinity and increased protection from environmental extremes for improved seed germination; 2) salinity remediation using HydraHume (TM); 3) seeding methodologies, including use of seed coating techniques; and 4) mycorrhizal inoculation methods.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin is the region of Europe most vulnerable to negative climate-change impacts, including forest decline, increased wildfire, and biodiversity loss. Because humans have affected Mediterranean ecosystems for millennia, it is unclear whether the region's native ecosystems were more resilient to climate change than current ecosystems, and whether they would provide sustainable management options if restored. We simulated vegetation with the LANDCLIM model, using present-day climate as well as future climate-change scenarios, in three representative areas that encompass a broad range of Mediterranean conditions and vegetation types. Sedimentary pollen records that document now-extinct forests help to validate the simulations. Forests modeled under present climate closely resemble the extinct forests when human disturbance is limited; under future scenarios, characterized by increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, extinct forests are projected to re-emerge. When combined with modeling, paleoecological evidence reveals the potential of native vegetation to re-establish under current and future climate conditions, and provides a template for novel management strategies to maintain forest productivity and biodiversity in a warmer and drier future.},

	abstract = {After causing widespread mortality in lodgepole pine forests in North America, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) has recently also affected ponderosa pine, an alternate host species that may have different levels of resilience to this disturbance. We collected field data in ponderosa pine- and lodgepole pine-dominated forests attacked by MPB in Colorado and then simulated stand growth over 200 years using the Forest Vegetation Simulator. We compared scenarios of no disturbance with scenarios of MPB-caused mortality, both with and without regeneration. Results indicated that basal area and tree density recovered to predisturbance levels relatively rapidly (within 1-8 decades) in both forest types. However, convergence of the disturbed conditions with simulated undisturbed conditions took longer (12-20+ decades) and was delayed by the absence of regeneration. In MPB-affected ponderosa pine forests without regeneration, basal area did not converge with undisturbed conditions within 200 years, implying lower resilience in this ecosystem. Surface fuels accumulated rapidly in both forest types after MPB-induced mortality, remaining high for 3-6 decades in simulations. Our results suggest that future patterns of succession, regeneration, fuel loading, climate, and disturbance interactions over long time periods should be considered in management strategies addressing MPB effects in either forest type, but particularly in ponderosa pine.},

	abstract = {1. The long history of river regulation has resulted in extensively changed ecosystem structures and processes in rivers and their associated environments. This fact, together with changing climatic and hydrological conditions, has increased the need to recover the natural functions of rivers. To develop guidelines for river restoration, comparative ecological experiments at contrasting water-level regimes are needed. We compared growth and survival of transplanted individuals of four riparian plant species (Betula pubescens, Carex acuta, Filipendula ulmaria and Leontodon autumnalis) over 2 years on four free-flowing and four regulated riverbank sites in northern Sweden. The species were chosen as representatives of dominating life-forms and species traits on different elevations of the riverbanks.
2. In Betula and Filipendula, mean proportional growth rates were significantly higher at free-flowing sites than at regulated sites, whereas no consistent differences between free-flowing and regulated sites were found in Carex and Leontodon. Differences among species were generally in accordance with natural distribution patterns along riverbank elevation gradients and with experimental evidence on flooding tolerance, although plants of all species survived and even showed positive growth rates on elevations below their natural range of occurrence.
3. Partial least squares regression was used to relate plant performance (growth and survival) to duration, frequency and timing of flooding at the different sites. Flood duration and frequency typically reduced performance in all species and during all time periods, although to various degrees. Flood events early in the experiment determined the outcome to a high degree at all sites. Variables indicating a regulated regime were mostly negatively related to plant performance, whereas free-flowing regime variables were positively related to plant performance.
4. We used two of the regression models generated from our data with an acceptably high predictive power to simulate a hypothetical re-regulation scenario in run-of-river impoundments. With an overall reduction in flooding duration and frequency of 50-75\%, plant performance of Filipendula at low riverbank elevations showed predicted increases of about 20-30\%, levelling off to zero at the highest elevations. Reductions in summer floods represented about one-third to half of this increase.
5. We conclude that for a range of species individual plant performance is clearly reduced on banks of impoundments and storage reservoirs due to changes in the water-level regime. Furthermore, our model simulation suggests that rather substantial reductions of flood duration and frequency are needed to improve plant performance on riverbanks upstream from dams in impounded rivers. River restoration principles should, however, be based on a combination of experimental data on plant performance of individual species and observed long-term changes in plant communities of regulated rivers. Consequently, successful re-regulation schemes in boreal rivers should include both reductions of summer and winter floods as well as re-introduced spring floods.},

	abstract = {An important question for salmon restoration efforts in the western USA is ‘How should habitat restoration plans be altered to accommodate climate change effects on stream flow and temperature?’ We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery, (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature, (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects, and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35–75\% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10–60\% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6°C by 2070–2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan.

Hence, we address the case of an old mineral processing plant and foundry, located in Chihuahua, Mexico. This study comprised site sampling, determination of Pb contents in the soil, and a risk analysis of the exposed child population via the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model (IEUBK, USEPA model). Three exposure scenarios were derived from the Pb concentrations found in soil and were classified as: maximum (A), average (B), and minimum (C). The IEUBK considered two amounts of soil intake: (350 mg/day) for areas without paved streets and (200 mg/day) for paved streets. Results show that 62\% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible level recommended for lixiviates, which indicates the solubility and possible dispersion of metal contents. 90\% of the samples exceed the permissible contents of Pb for residential use and 85\% are above guidelines for industrial use. Results from the IEUBK model, considering unpaved streets, show that the average concentration of Pb in blood in scenarios A, B, and C were 79.94, 16.58, and 9.25 g/dL, respectively. For communities with paved streets and under the same conditions, the amounts of Pb in blood decreased to 57.75, 11.57, and 4.18 g/dL respectively. In both cases, the maximum permissible concentration of Pb in children's blood is exceeded. It is imperative to take the appropriate remediation measures in this site to reduce the Pb contents in the soil and to minimize the public health risk.

	abstract = {Wastewater reuse has been recognized as an encouraging solution to cope with the problem of water scarcity around the globe. Adopting Integrated Water Resources Management principles will ensure that the implementation of wastewater reuse projects will take into account all the various types of affected stakeholders, accounting in addition for the external costs and benefits derived from the reuse decision. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic, social and environmental aspects surrounding the concept of wastewater reuse in order to assist policy-makers and managers on the implementation of economic instruments for decision-making. This study proposes a methodological framework for conducting cost-benefit analysis, which is later exemplified by the Yarqon Recycling Project case study in Israel. In this case study application, 3 different scenarios ("pessimistic", "base-case" and "optimistic") with a range of parameters values, were used to estimate the most relevant internal and external costs and benefits. Additionally, the most influential parameters were identified using a sensitivity analysis that included both Monte Carlo simulations and the standardized regression coefficients method. For the "base-case" scenario, the net present value obtained was approximately \$4.83 million. Although the feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the sensitivity analysis results were less favorable (likelihood of obtaining a positive result was only 64.28\%), being the external recreational costs derived from irrigating with reclaimed wastewater the most influential parameter. The results of this analysis led to the conclusion that including the relevant externalities might have a strong impact on the economic feasibility of the wastewater reuse projects. The proposed methodological framework aims to guide decision-makers in evaluating their success with respect to Integrated Water Resources Management in economic terms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Fisheries resource conservation is a national priority in the USA because of the high economic and social value of fish to society. Landscape spatial planning to identify focal areas for conservation of fishes is an important step to targeted site-level interventions to protect or restore fish habitats, because it can provide a strategic approach to guide conservation efforts. Computerized spatial planning algorithms that identify networks of sites that meet user-specified targets for species representation indicate locations with favourable conditions for fish protection. Here a commonly used systematic planning software, Marxan, was employed with previously published fish range and human disturbance predictions to define a network of conservation focal areas for rivers in Michigan. This network focused on large-bodied species, small-bodied species, species of greatest conservation need (SGCN), and all species together. Depending on the scenario, the networks identified comprised between 14 and 20\% of Michigan stream length in over 1700 focal areas ranging from 6 to 8?km in average length. Mean focal area sizes were much larger for the Upper Peninsula than the Lower Peninsula. Approximately 35\% of the focal areas defined flowed through already protected lands, but less than 5\% had upstream catchments that were secure within protected areas. There was a 45\% overlap in the focal areas selected for the large- and small-bodied fish and SGCN. The rivers defined may serve as appropriate core areas for fish conservation. Resultant maps show locations with a high natural potential to conserve all of Michigan's native fish species, and can serve as a reference point for regionalization of comprehensive state-wide planning efforts for fish conservation. It is recommended that this study is followed up with additional planning steps to define complementary conservation zones for protecting the functionality of ecosystems to support fishes, and to forward methods for incorporating spatial metapopulation dynamics into the planning process.

We accounted for pollinator behaviour by including potential links into temporal snapshots (12 consecutive 2-week networks) to reflect mutualists' ability to 'switch' interaction partners (re-wiring). Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if species formed new interactions. Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that promote the extinction of the strongest interactors might induce a sudden collapse of pollination networks.},

Effective conservation of tidal marsh birds requires that management actions be prioritized based on their impact to the long-term population viability for these species. We used a population viability analysis to evaluate the relative influence of two sea level rise scenarios and two prescribed fire management scenarios on the population viability of seaside sparrows, a tidal marsh obligate species, at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Bay Wildlife Management Area. Marsh loss caused by rising sea levels had a greater impact on seaside sparrow population viability than did prescribed fire. Limiting marsh loss over the next 50 years to 15\% of the present extent caused a 19\% probability of reaching the quasi-extinction threshold, while losing 33\% of extant marsh caused a 50\% probability of reaching the quasi-extinction threshold. Prescribed fire increased the likelihood of seaside sparrow persistence; increasing the amount of frequently-burned marsh from 12\% to 53\% lowered the quasi-extinction probability from 0.20 to 0.10. Slowing the rate of marsh loss will have a greater positive effect on seaside sparrow viability than increasing the frequency of prescribed fire. Sea level rise poses the single greatest threat to the long-term persistence of tidal marsh bird populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The study was located in the drained fen Calowanie (central Poland), where remnants of open fen communities and willow-invaded fens exist in former turf-pits, surrounded by degraded meadows on dried peat. All these three habitat types were included in a monitoring grid, which covered an area of 2.2 ha. Within 55 quadrats of 20 m x 20 m we monitored occurrence of 52 species, i.e. two groups of target species (fen indicators and wet meadow indicators) and indicators of two failure scenarios (degraded fen indicators and eutrophic wetland indicators), during sixy ears following shrub removal, rewetting and re-application of conservational mowing, using a 3-step ordinal abundance scale. NMDS ordination revealed a gradual convergence of shrub removal plots and reference plots. We noticed significant effects of year and habitat type on all indicator groups, but only fen indicators have shown a clear (increasing) trend within shrub removal plots. Degraded fen indicators (ruderal and opportunistic species) initially expanded on shrub removal plots, but this effect disappeared in the following years. We conclude that shrub removal enhances establishment of target species in a moderately drained and then rewetted fen and attribute this effect to lowered competition for light. However, given high costs of this method and long-lasting problems with shrub resprouts, we recommend applying shrub removal only to recently overgrown sites, which still retained high botanical diversity. Heavily degraded fen meadows did not react on the increase of moisture, which indicates that more advanced restoration measures, such as top soil removal are needed there. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {Offset schemes are advocated as a way that continued development and environmental restoration can be achieved concurrently. We used a simple modelling approach to evaluate proposed offsets schemes, with scenarios that required offsetting the impacts of clearing woodlands either by revegetation of cleared land or by improving the habitat value of degraded woodland. Each simulation used the attribute table of a single GIS polygon layer to obtain data and record results. We investigated the likely consequences of these schemes for three groups of species with different foraging resource requirements: shrub-dependent; canopy-dependent and old tree-dependent. Only the shrub-dependent group, whose requirements could be rapidly grown, saw increases in suitable habitat in the landscape within our 30 year simulations. The habitat of the canopy-dependent group initially declined but began to increase towards the end of some simulations, while the old tree-dependent group's habitat declined. When a simple measure of spatial configuration was considered further differences between the schemes were highlighted. The simulation results demonstrate that assessing only the eventual benefit score of a scheme can hide the losses sustained by some elements of biodiversity. We recommend this type of simple modelling approach as the first step in determining whether a proposed offsets scheme is worth investigating further. In particular, the ability to represent the scheme's predicted consequences as maps and graphs assists decision makers in judging whether the scheme has sufficient merit to warrant a full assessment and subsequent implementation; or needs some adjustments to achieve its aims, or is seriously flawed.

In this study, the FAREAST gap model was used to examine the response of forest dynamics on Gongga Mountain, which is located on the southeastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau, under three climate change scenarios. The simulated results showed that the climax community of the deglaciation slash would be mixed species of Picea brachytyla, Tsuga chinensis, and Pinus densata under climate change scenarios, as opposed to the pure Abies fabri forest under the current climate. Climate change also drove replacement of Populus purdomiis by Betula utilis, which became the most abundant pioneer tree species on the deglaciation slash. Under scenarios of climate change, three responses of the four typical forests distributed between 2200 and 3580 m above sea level are observed, such as dieback of today's forest at 2200 and 3150 m, gradual change of the species composition at 2780 m, and afforestation at 3580 m. It is worth noting that the scenarios of climatic change are of inherent uncertainty, in the same way as the formulation of the ecological factors used in the models. It is suggested that simulations not be interpreted as predictions of the future development of the forest, but as a means of assessing their sensitivity to climate change. It is concluded that mountainous forests are quite sensitive to climate change.},

	abstract = {This study aims to provide a quantitative framework to model the dynamics of Mediterranean coniferous forests by integrating existing ecological data within a generic mathematical simulator. We developed an individual-based vegetation dynamics model, constrained on long-term field regeneration data, analyses of tree-rings and seed germination experiments. The simulator implements an asymmetric competition algorithm which is based on the location and size of each individual. Growth is parameterized through the analysis of tree-rings from more than thirty individuals of each of the three species of interest. A super-individual approach is implemented to simulate regeneration dynamics, constrained with available regeneration data across time-since-disturbance and light-availability gradients. The study concerns an insular population of an endemic to Greece Mediterranean fir (Abies cephalonica Loudon) on the island of Cephalonia (Ionian Sea) and two interacting populations of a Mediterranean pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) and a more temperate-oriented pine (Pinus nigra Am. ssp. pallasiana) on the island of Lesbos (NE Aegean Sea), Greece. The model was validated against plot-level observations in terms of species standing biomass and regeneration vigour and adequately captured regeneration patterns and overall vegetation dynamics in both study sites. The potential effects of changing climatic patterns on the regeneration dynamics of the three species of interest were subsequently explored. With the assumption that a warmer future would probably cause changes in the duration of cold days, we tested how this change would affect the overall dynamics of the study sites, by focusing on the process of cold stratification upon seed germination. Following scenarios of a warmer future and under the current model parameterization, changes in the overall regeneration vigour controlled by a reduction in the amount of cold days, did not alter the overall dynamics in all plant populations studied. No changes were identified in the relative dominance of the interacting pine populations on Lesbos, while the observed reduction in the amount of emerging seedlings of A. cephalonica on Cephalonia did not affect biomass yield at later stages of stand development.

	abstract = {Oyster beds are disappearing worldwide through a combination of over-harvesting, diseases, and salinity alterations in the coastal zone. Sensitivity of oysters to variable discharge and salinity is particularly acute in small sub-tropical estuaries subject to regulated freshwater releases. South Florida has sub-tropical estuaries where watershed flood control sometimes results in excessive freshwater inflow to estuaries during the wet season (May-Oct) and reduced discharge and increased salinities in the dry season (Nov-Apr). The potential to reserve freshwater accumulated during the wet season could offer the capacity to regulate freshwater at different temporal scales, thus optimizing salinity conditions for estuarine biota. The goal of this study was to use simulation modeling to explore the effects of freshwater inflows and salinity on adult oyster survival in the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) in southwest Florida. Water managers derived three different freshwater inflow scenarios for the CRE based on historical and modified watershed attributes for the time period of 1965-2000. Three different salinity time series were generated from the inflow scenarios at each of three sites in the lower CRE and used to conduct nine different oyster simulations. Overall, the predicted densities of adult oysters in the upstream site were 3-4 times greater in seasons that experienced reduced freshwater inflow (e.g., increased salinity) with oyster density in the lower estuary much less influenced by the inflows. Potential storage of freshwater reduced the frequency of extreme flows in the wet season and helped to maintain minimum inflow in the dry season near the estuarine mouth. Analyses of inflows indicated that discharges ranging from 0 to 1,500 cfs could promote favorable salinities of 10-25 in the lower CRE depending on wet versus dry season climatic conditions. This range of inflows is similar to that derived in other studies of the CRE and emphasizes the value of simulation models to help prescribe freshwater releases which benefit estuarine biota.},

	abstract = {One of the critical problems in projecting soil bioengineering interventions is the difficulty in developing precise calculations of the evolution of the structures and the type and combination of vegetation plantations that are planned for the particular site and problem. This is mainly due to the uncertainties in the plant development in each type of soil, the long and short term weather patterns and other edapho-climatic factors that determine limited calculation possibilities causing considerable degrees of uncertainty. This leads to a reduced level of reliability of bioengineering projects in terms of predetermined factors of safety. In Mediterranean conditions this problem is even stronger due to the high seasonal and year-to-year climatic variability, and high degree of uncertainty in the vegetation installment and growth patterns. To evaluate the comparative short and long term (up to 20 years) efficacy of the most used slope stabilization techniques, common calculation models were used to assess the factor of safety of those techniques. SLIP4EX was used to evaluate the factor of safety, while the normal Coulomb model was used to assess the resistance to sliding and overturning. Considering the average Mediterranean climatic conditions, the considered environmental conditions were the least favorable, in order to assess the reliability of the "worst case scenario". Two common tree species in the western Mediterranean region (Pinus halepensis and Quercus faginea) were selected for the simulation and three common soil types were considered (stony clay, loose sandstone and sandy marl). The results of the simulations for different types of substrates, plant combinations and designs, show that, according to the modeling approaches, the use of soil bioengineering techniques, present a reliable effectiveness, confirmed by the experience gathered in interventions in Mediterranean sites with similar edapho-climatic conditions. Additionally, because bioengineering is about the factor of safety of the target vegetation after the decay of the combined structure, the efficiency as a slope support structure of a vegetated log cribwall was compared with the expected developed vegetation. It was concluded that an adequate development of the vegetation ensures all safety requirements even in the worst considered scenarios. Our results also illustrate that there is a generalized lack of data on the geotechnical characteristics of the Mediterranean vegetation, which is particularly critical in a geo-ecological context where bioengineering techniques face important limitations (very few species able of vegetative development of roots and shoots from live cuttings).

In the Manistee River, a tributary to Lake Michigan, two hydroelectric dams potentially limit recruitment of anadromous rainbow,trout (steelhead) by increasing tailrace water temperatures to levels that significantly reduce survival of young-of-year (YOY) fish. The objectives of this study were to determine whether proposed restoration scenarios (dam removals or a bottom withdrawal retrofit) would alter the Manistee River thermal regime and, consequently, improve wild steelhead survival and recruitment. Physical process models were used to predict Manistee River thermal regimes following each dam alteration scenario. Empirical relationships were derived from historical field surveys to quantify the effect of temperature on YOY production and potential recruitment of Manistee River steelhead. Both dam alteration scenarios lowered summer temperatures and increased steelhead recruitment by between 59\% and 129\%, but total recruitments were still low compared to other Great Lakes tributaries. Considering only temperature effects, bottom withdrawal provides the greatest promise for increasing natural steelhead recruitment by decreasing the likelihood of year-class failures in the warmest summers. Results of this study may allow managers to evaluate mitigation alternatives for Manistee River dams during future relicensing negotiations, and illustrate the utility of physical process. temperature models in groundwater-fed rivers.

This research used dye tracking and head loss measurements in a 1:500 planimetrically scaled laboratory river table to quantify the spatial and temporal intensification of intra-meander flux rates at two evolution ages. The younger meander bend, M1, had a sinuosity of 2.3, a river neck width of 0.39cm, and 0.6\% river slope, and the older meander bend, M3, had a sinuosity of 5.2, a river neck width of 0.12cm, and 0.5\% river slope. Flux into and out of the meander bend was estimated along the normalized curvilinear distance s*, with the meander neck at s*=0.1 and s*=0.9, the meander centroid at s*=0.37 and s*=0.63, and the apex at s*=0.5. Between the meander centroid and neck, we documented a 60\% spatial intensification for M1 and a 90\% spatial intensification for M3. Between M1 and M3, we documented a 135\% temporal intensification at the neck and a 100\% intensification at the centroid. Our empirical spatial and temporal intensification rates involving the M1 and the M3 scenario were one to three times lower than theoretical rates derived from a river evolution model with equivalent M1 and M3 planimetry. Overestimation by the theoretical model was attributed to exaggerated head loss caused by the model neglecting groundwater contributions to river stage. Hyporheic exchange provides critical ecosystem services, and its spatial and temporal variation with meander evolution should be considered in river management.

The objective is to employ scenario analysis to inform and improve existing instream flow restoration projects. We assess the sensitivity of late summer (July, August, and September) flows to the following scenario simulations – singly or in combination: climate change, changes in the quantity of water used for irrigation and possible changes to existing water resource policy. Flows for four sub-basins were modeled using the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) under historical and projected conditions of 2020 and 2040 for each scenario. Results indicate that Yakima will be the most flow-limited sub-basin with average reductions in streamflow of 41\% under climate conditions of 2020 and 56\% under 2040 conditions; 1.3–2.5 times greater than those of other sub-basins. In addition, irrigation plays a key role in the hydrology of the Yakima sub-basin – with flow reductions ranging from 78\% to 90\% under severe to extreme (i.e., 20–40\%) increases in agricultural water use (2.0–4.4 times the reductions in the other sub-basins). The Yakima and Okanogan sub-basins are the most responsive to simulations of flow-bolstering policy change (providing salmon with first priority water allocation and at biologically relevant flows), as demonstrated by 91–100\% target flows attained. The Wenatchee and Methow sub-basins do not exhibit similar responsiveness to simulated policy changes. Considering climate change only, we conclude that flow restoration should be prioritized first in the Yakima and Wenatchee sub-basins, and second in the Okanogan and Methow. Considering both climate change and possible policy changes, we recommend that the Yakima sub-basin receive the highest priority for flow restoration activities to sustain critical instream habitat for ESA-listed salmonids.},

	abstract = {Lake Winnipeg is Canada's sixth largest lake and the world's 10th largest freshwater lake with a surface area of 24,500 km2. The Lake experiences eutrophication and increasing algal blooms due likely to nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff. Lake Winnipeg receives surface water discharges from the Lake Winnipeg Basin which spans across 106 km2; including four provinces and four states. Major rivers that flow into Lake Winnipeg include the Saskatchewan, Winnipeg, Red and Dauphin Rivers. These four rivers account for more than 80\% of the Lake inflow. The Winnipeg River has the largest inflow at 45\% of the total Lake inflow but the Red River dominates nutrient loadings with 63\% of the Lake’s phosphorus loading. An integrated modelling approach has been used to analyze and provide solutions to the Lake Winnipeg eutrophication problem. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is the watershed runoff model being used to simulate sediment and nutrient loadings from the La Salle River watershed (2,400 km2), which will then be up scaled to represent the entire Red River watershed, and then these loadings will be used as input to the lake model, OneLay/PolTra (O/P), to simulate the Lake’s water quality. This integrated modelling approach has been found to provide a more flexible and efficient means to examine various remediation methods in the watershed. Only the Red River nutrient loads are being modelled due to its dominance of nutrient loads to the lake. The La Salle River empties into the Red River near Winnipeg, is 80\% agricultural, and contributes approximately 1\% of the nutrient load to the Red River watershed. The O/P model includes the 4 major inflowing rivers but only the Red River will vary during calibration and scenario analysis. The other 3 river loadings are based on observed data. Using artificial intelligence to determine the most optimal calibrations for loading provides for better calibration for SWAT and O/P through integrated modelling. A genetic algorithm is used to auto calibrate the integrated models. As a first attempt, model parameters being calibrated include those related to total suspended sediment (TSS) loadings from the SWAT model and in-lake suspended sediment concentrations from the O/P model. The objective functions used in the genetic algorithm is the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The integrated model calibration incorporates back calibration or two-way calibration to improve the overall objective.. Initial results from the two-way calibration of the integrated SWAT and O/P models show the NRMSE for the watershed and lake TSS are 0.18 and 0.12, respectively. With a Bayesian network, the uncertainty propagation of the integrated models is estimated to be 29.2\%. This uncertainty is reasonable given the lack of precise input data, the simplicity of the Upscaler model from the LaSalle Watershed to Lake Winnipeg; and the significant spatial resolution change from the SWAT model to the O/P model. With the successful implementation of this integrated modelling approach, we plan to populate this approach to other watersheds in the Lake Winnipeg Basin and beyond where data is available.},

	abstract = {The Northwest Fork of the Loxahatchee River contains one of the last examples of a pristine subtropical riverine cypress swamp in South Florida. The permanent opening of the Jupiter Inlet along with sea level rise and reduced dry season freshwater flows in the Northwest Fork has allowed salt water to migrate upriver causing the introduction of mangroves into areas once dominated by freshwater floodplain swamp vegetation, particularly bald cypress. Restoration of this natural resource requires reducing or reversing the current condition of saltwater intrusion and maintaining the freshwater habitats in the upper reaches of the Northwest Fork to protect existing populations and distribution of wildlife that require freshwater habitat. A computer program was developed to predict salinity and calculate other performance parameters under various ecosystem restoration scenarios. Field data, regression analysis and results of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic computer models were integrated into a system simulation and management tool. Salinity prediction and other computations were conducted over a 39-year period. Such long-term simulations are required to investigate ecosystem response and assess the effectiveness of the proposed restoration approach. The model also contains system management functions such as the calculation of additional freshwater demand for salinity management under various restoration alternatives.

	title = {An integrated modelling approach to balancing trade-off issues in natural resource management},
	shorttitle = {An integrated modelling approach to balancing trade-off issues in natural resource management},
	abstract = {The south-west region of the Goulburn-Broken catchment (SWG) in northern Victoria is facing
a range of natural resource challenges. High salt load export from the region affects water quality and
contributes to stream degradation in the Murray River system. Traditionally, salinity management strategies
have focused on increasing plant water use (e.g. tree planting). In recent years, however, there has been
growing concern that the prevailing dry climatic conditions and revegetation are threatening the water supply
and health of ecosystem. In this context, it will require a flexible and carefully balanced strategy to achieve
the contrasting objectives of remediating land salinisation and reducing salt export while maintaining water
supply security to satisfy human consumptive use and support in-stream and terrestrial biodiversity.
To explore the trade-offs for these two contrasting objectives, this study linked the 2CSalt model (Weeks et
al., 2005) to CAT1D to investigate the effect of land use change and climate variation on stream flow and salt
export in the SWG region. The CAT1D comprises a suite of farming systems models ranging in complexity
from a simple crop factor approach to phenologically-based crop and pasture modules. The models were
calibrated for all gauged catchments in the region. The risk and uncertainty analysis associated with the
2CSalt model was carried out by undertaking numerical and statistical simulations. The modelling explored
and contrasted the impacts of a series of different focused revegetation and climate scenarios:
• Three biodiversity scenarios based on Ecological Vegetation Classes (EVC) coverage and landscape
context scores
• Three revegetation scenarios focused on minimising salt export from the SWG region
• Three revegetation scenarios focused on minimising losses in catchment yield
• Three scenarios for climate change based on the outputs of CSIRO's regional climate models for high,
medium and low IPCC emissions scenarios (CSIRO, 2007).
The results of this modeling work indicated:
• All three focused biodiversity planting scenarios approximately mapped along the linear baseline (i.e. the
linear line between the current practice and 100 \% tree cover scenarios) for stream flow, base flow and
salt load impacts. This indicates that planting to satisfy biodiversity needs is unlikely to have any
additional impacts on stream flow and salt load above random plantings across the SWG region.
• The three focused salt reduction scenarios are much more effective in reducing salt than that indicated by
the linear baseline, while only slightly decreasing stream flows compared to the baseline. This result
provides support for salinity management strategies while not disproportionately impacting upon flows.
• The focused stream flow retention scenarios are reasonably effective in minimising stream flow loss
while at the same time being slightly less effective in reducing salt compared to the baseline. These
results indicated that stream flow declines can be substantially lessened by targeting native and plantation
forestry activities without significantly increasing salt export.
• Although the modelling revealed that the impacts of targeting vegetation are significant on stream flow
and salt export, climate change scenarios will have an equal if not more significant impact on these issues
over the next 70 years.
The modelling indicated that the impact of land use and climate change is complex. Analysis indicates that
there is pronounced correlation between climate and mean annual stream flow, base flow and salt export, and
these relationships appear to be non-linear. The knowledge gained through this study has informed a NRM
trade-off decision process that aims to develop and prioritise NRM options},

For each species, we added hectares of land from lowest to highest cost per additional year of forest cover until the conservation target was achieved throughout the time period. Climate change was predicted to reduce the size of species ranges, the overlap between species ranges and existing or planned protected areas, and the overlap between species ranges and existing forest. As a result, climate change increased the cost of achieving the conservation target by necessitating successively more costly management actions: additional management within existing protected areas (US\$060/ha); avoidance of forest degradation (i.e., loss of biomass) in community-managed areas (\$160576/ha); avoidance of deforestation in unprotected areas (\$2521069/ha); and establishment of forest on nonforested land within protected areas (\$8022710/ha), in community-managed areas (\$9623226/ha), and in unprotected areas (\$10543719/ha). Our results suggest that although forest restoration may be required for the conservation of some species as climate changes, it is more cost-effective to maintain existing forest wherever possible.},

Results from this analysis constitute the habitat inputs to a population model linking changes in habitat to salmon population status.

However, high uncertainty about the biodiversity outcomes of offsetting strategies has led to significant criticism in the academic and policy literature, while the ad-hoc application of offset rules within a region may lead to offsets favouring some species and communities at the expense of others. Here we explored opportunities to improve offsetting outcomes through strategic regional offset approaches, underpinned by concepts of complementarity and irreplaceability from the conservation planning literature, in comparison to more commonly used like-for-like approach. We assessed different offsetting strategies in the Hunter Valley, NSW, a rapidly developing region in Australia with an active mining industry. We quantified regional-level biodiversity losses arising from minimal to extensive mining expansion, along with species-specific impacts for 569 flora and fauna species, and prioritized areas for protection, restoration or both to offset the anticipated losses. Accounting for how well the offsets would complement existing protected areas, we compared the area needed for offsetting and the expected biodiversity outcomes among the different strategies. Our results highlight the benefits of a more systematic approach to offsetting in terms of an enhanced understanding of regional-scale impacts, more efficient identification of offset sites and improved biodiversity outcomes. Our approach encourages forward thinking about impending threats to, and opportunities for, biodiversity conservation and could serve as a template for strategic regional offset planning based on plausible scenarios of future biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {The rate of new exotic recruitment following removal of adult invaders (reinvasion pressure) influences restoration outcomes and costs but is highly variable and poorly understood. We hypothesize that broad variation in average reinvasion pressure of Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree, a major invader) arises from differences among habitats in spatiotemporal availability of realized recruitment windows. These windows are periods of variable duration long enough to permit establishment given local environmental conditions. We tested this hypothesis via a greenhouse mesocosm experiment that quantified how the duration of favorable moisture conditions prior to flood or drought stress (window duration), competition and nutrient availability influenced Triadica success in high stress environments. Window duration influenced pre-stress seedling abundance and size, growth during stress and final abundance; it interacted with other factors to affect final biomass and germination during stress. Stress type and competition impacted final size and biomass, plus germination, mortality and changes in size during stress. Final abundance also depended on competition and the interaction of window duration, stress type and competition. Fertilization interacted with competition and stress to influence biomass and changes in height, respectively, but did not affect Triadica abundance. Overall, longer window durations promoted Triadica establishment, competition and drought (relative to flood) suppressed establishment, and fertilization had weak effects. Interactions among factors frequently produced different effects in specific contexts. Results support our 'outgrow the stress' hypothesis and show that temporal availability of abiotic windows and factors that influence growth rates govern Triadica recruitment in stressful environments. These findings suggest that native seed addition can effectively suppress superior competitors in stressful environments. We also describe environmental scenarios where specific management methods may be more or less effective. Our results enable better niche-based estimates of local reinvasion pressure, which can improve restoration efficacy and efficiency by informing site selection and optimal management.},

However, the last several decades have demonstrated a decline in resilience that has often resulted in phase shifts to a degraded coral-depleted state with high levels of algal abundance. A major defining issue in current research is to identify when and how it is possible to reverse these phase shifts allowing for the ecosystem to escape coral depletion and maintain coral-based ecosystem services. We extend an analytic model to focus on the effects of over-harvesting of herbivorous reef fish in the Caribbean by explicitly including grazer dynamics which introduces feedbacks between habitat and grazer abundance posing constraints on management options excluded in previous studies. This allows us to develop ecosystem-based management recommendations for two distinct scenarios of coral reef recovery: The first follows significant habitat damage in response to a large disturbance and the second maintains reef structure but has suffered from events such as coral bleaching. We identify critical fishing effort levels to allow for coral recovery and demonstrate that regions exhibiting severe damage to reef structure have little resilience implying that fishing reductions should be coupled with other restoration methods. Regions that are coral-depleted but maintain reef structure allow for recovery given sufficiently small levels of fishing mortality. However, we demonstrate the difference in recovery time in response to varying levels of control efforts on fishing.},

Landscape scale agricultural and urban modifications require flood control which sometimes results in the release of excess freshwater that potentially damages estuarine ecology. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District focused on restoring natural patterns of freshwater flow to the Everglades and associated estuaries. One of the primary project goals is to reduce deleterious inflows eastward to the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) and westward to the Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) by diverting freshwater south from Lake Okeechobee. Performance evaluation of the CEPP relies upon integrated modeling which links the watershed engineering projects to estuarine salinities and biotic responses. The objective of this study was to utilize seagrass and oyster models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative inflow scenarios. There are three different scenarios: the existing condition base (ECB), the future without proposed CEPP projects (FWO) but with other landscape features that could alter freshwater inflows, and alternative 4R (ALT4R) that incorporates a suite of restoration projects including those associated with the CEPP. Each of these inflow scenarios was used to generate daily salinity time series from 1965 to 2005 at multiple locations in the SLE and CRE which were used to run site-specific seagrass and oyster models. The hydrodynamic and ecological effects of freshwater inflow were greater in the SLE compared to the much larger CRE. Predicted densities of oysters (individuals m−2) and seagrass (shoots m−2) were greater in the wet season (May–Oct) vs. the dry season (Nov–Apr) in both estuaries. Oyster and seagrass densities increased under the ALT4R inflow scenario that mitigated high inflows to the estuaries in the wet season. This result improved environmental conditions while increasing freshwater availability for other parts of the Greater Everglades and the southern estuaries such as Florida Bay and Biscayne Bay.},

	abstract = {To effectively manage large natural reserves, resource managers must prepare for future contingencies while balancing the often conflicting priorities of different stakeholders. To deal with these issues, managers routinely employ models to project the response of ecosystems to different scenarios that represent alternative management plans or environmental forecasts. Scenario analysis is often used to rank such alternatives to aid the decision making process. However, model projections are subject to uncertainty in assumptions about model structure, parameter values, environmental inputs, and subcomponent interactions. We introduce an approach for testing the robustness of model-based management decisions to the uncertainty inherent in complex ecological models and their inputs. We use relative assessment to quantify the relative impacts of uncertainty on scenario ranking. To illustrate our approach we consider uncertainty in parameter values and uncertainty in input data, with specific examples drawn from the Florida Everglades restoration project. Our examples focus on two alternative 30-year hydrologic management plans that were ranked according to their overall impacts on wildlife habitat potential. We tested the assumption that varying the parameter settings and inputs of habitat index models does not change the rank order of the hydrologic plans. We compared the average projected index of habitat potential for four endemic species and two wading-bird guilds to rank the plans, accounting for variations in parameter settings and water level inputs associated with hypothetical future climates. Indices of habitat potential were based on projections from spatially explicit models that are closely tied to hydrology. For the American alligator, the rank order of the hydrologic plans was unaffected by substantial variation in model parameters. By contrast, simulated major shifts in water levels led to reversals in the ranks of the hydrologic plans in 24.1-30.6\% of the projections for the wading bird guilds and several individual species. By exposing the differential effects of uncertainty, relative assessment can help resource managers assess the robustness of scenario choice in model-based policy decisions.},

	abstract = {Background

Commercial forestry programs normally use locally collected seed for reforestation under the assumption that tree populations are optimally adapted to local environments. However, in western Canada this assumption is no longer valid because of climate trends that have occurred over the last several decades. The objective of this study is to show how we can arrive at reforestation recommendations with alternative species and genotypes that are viable under a majority of climate change scenarios.
Methodology/Principal Findings

In a case study for commercially important tree species of Alberta, we use an ecosystem-based bioclimate envelope modeling approach for western North America to project habitat for locally adapted populations of tree species using multi-model climate projections for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. We find that genotypes of species that are adapted to drier climatic conditions will be the preferred planting stock over much of the boreal forest that is commercially managed. Interestingly, no alternative species that are currently not present in Alberta can be recommended with any confidence. Finally, we observe large uncertainties in projections of suitable habitat that make reforestation planning beyond the 2050s difficult for most species.
Conclusion/Significance

More than 50,000 hectares of forests are commercially planted every year in Alberta. Choosing alternative planting stock, suitable for expected future climates, could therefore offer an effective climate change adaptation strategy at little additional cost. Habitat projections for locally adapted tree populations under observed climate change conform well to projections for the 2020s, which suggests that it is a safe strategy to change current reforestation practices and adapt to new climatic realities through assisted migration prescriptions.},

	abstract = {Long-term societal trends which include decreasing population in structurally poorer regions and changes in agricultural policies have been leading to land abandonment in various regions of Europe. One of the consequences of this development includes spontaneous forest regeneration of formerly open-land habitats with likely significant effects on plant and animal diversity. We assess potential effects of agricultural decline in Switzerland (41,000 km2) and potential impacts on the spatial distribution of seven open-land species (insects, reptile, birds) under land-use change scenarios: (1) a business-as-usual scenario that extrapolates trends observed during the last 15 years into the future, (2) a liberalisation scenario with limited regulation, and (3) a lowered agricultural production scenario fostering conservation. All scenarios were developed in collaboration with socio-economists. Results show that spontaneous reforestation is potentially minor in the lowlands since combinations of socio-economic (better accessibility), topographic (less steep slopes), and climatic factors (longer growing seasons) favour agricultural use and make land abandonment less likely. Land abandonment, spontaneous reforestation, and subsequent loss of open-land, however, are potentially pronounced in mountainous areas except where tourism is a major source of income. Here, socio-economic and natural conditions for cultivation are more difficult, leading to higher abandonment and thus reforestation likelihood. Evaluations for open-land species core habitats indicate pronounced spatial segregation of expected landscape change. Habitat losses (up to 59\%) are observed throughout the country, particularly at high elevation sites in the Northern Alps. Habitat gains under the lowered agricultural production scenario range between 12 and 41\% and are primarily observed for the Plateau and the Northern Alps.},

Habitat above three major hydropower dams in the Lewis River watershed, southwestern Washington, USA, will soon become accessible to anadromous. fish. We used multiple models to estimate habitat conditions above dams and fish population responses. Additionally, we used scenario planning to predict how habitat and fish will respond to potential future trends in land use due to human population growth and riparian conservation policies. Finally, we developed a hypothetical management strategy (i.e., a set of prioritized restoration projects in specific locations within the watershed) as an example of how a fixed amount of restoration funds might be spent to enhance the success of reintroducing fish above dams. We then compared predicted outcomes from this new strategy to those of six previously modeled strategies. We estimated how the choice of the best management strategy might differ among alternative future scenarios. Results suggest that dam passage will provide access to large amounts of high-quality habitat that will benefit fish populations. Moreover, conservation of existing riparian areas, if implemented, has the potential to improve conditions to a much greater extent than restoration strategies examined, despite expected urban growth. We found that the relative performance of management strategies shifted when fish were allowed to migrate above dams, but less so among alternative futures examined. We discuss how predicted outcomes from these seven hypothetical management strategies could be used for developing an on-the-ground strategy to address a real management situation.},

Very few horticultural data exists on this species, calibration can only be done based on estimates and on educated ecological sense. This fruit was selected to be modeled because it is native to the Eastern US and because very little is known about it. Perhaps, with the construction of a model some insight on its productivity can be obtained. The interest in this fruit stems from a deeper problem. As a consequence of the increased pollution in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, different actions have been taken in order to control and restore its environment. Among such actions, the building and maintenance of riparian forest buffer strips has been suggested and enforced. Farmers have been adamant about implementing these new approaches because land would have to be taken out of production, thus incurring an economic loss. However, if the riparian forest buffer is enhanced with economically viable non timber species, profit could be made from the land. The authors suggest the use of pawpaws as one of many options to include in the harvestable zone of the riparian forest buffer system. Three biological scenarios and four economical scenarios were tested in the model. We observed that unless pawpaw harvesting associated wages are cut, or subsidies for the economical exploitation of pawpaw riparian buffer strips are generous, the financial viability of such buffer strips using pawpaw as the harvestable species is reduced. In one of such scenarios, given a 5 ha pawpaw riparian buffer strip, where the farmer pays no wages, the pawpaw fruit is sold at \$0.99 each, and the buffer is planted from new, the net present value of the buffer strip is \$26 396.60.},

	abstract = {Context Recent papers on the spatial assessment of conservation opportunity have focused on how social values for conservation may change modeled conservation outcomes. Accounting for social factors is important for regional wildlife corridor initiatives as they often emphasize the collaborative aspects of conservation planning.
Objectives We present an approach for characterizing the potential effects of public conservation orientation and projected future development land use scenarios on landscape connectivity.
Methods Using public participation GIS techniques (mail-based surveys linked to a mapping component), we classified spatially explicit conservation values and preferences into a conservation orientation index consisting of positive, negative, or neutral scores. Connectivity was then modeled using a least-cost path and graph-network approach for a range of conservation orientation and development scenarios in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. Scenarios were modelled through either adding vegetation (positive orientation) or removing vegetation (negative orientation, development).
Results Scenarios that included positive conservation orientation link the isolated eastern and western reaches of the Lower Hunter, even when negative conservation scores were included in the model. This outcome is consistent with proposed connectivity corridors identified in regional strategies. The development scenario showed connectivity patterns similar to only modelling negative conservation orientation scores, with greater fragmentation across the region.
Conclusions The modeled outcomes showed consistency between the public's conservation orientation and the ecological rationale for increasing connectivity within the region. If conservation orientation can be translated into conservation initiatives, the result will be enhanced regional landscape connectivity that is both ecologically beneficial, as well as socially acceptable.},

	abstract = {Callophrys irus (Frosted Elfin) is threatened under New York State conservation law and has fewer than 5 secure populations within the state. Published research on these populations is needed to support the development of a state recovery plan and monitoring program for the species. We assessed the relationship between adult occupancy (patch use) in the Albany Pine Bush Preserve and a suite of potential controlling factors. We then used the results in a simulation framework to quantitatively inform how many sites and surveys are needed for Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring. Patch use was best explained by a model that assumed the same occupancy probability for each patch. The species was more likely to use patches with limited shrub cover and greater host plant density, yet showed a good chance ({\textgreater}= 76\%) of using even the smaller patches ({\textless}1 ha) with relatively sparse density ({\textless}1000 ramets ha(-1)). Detection probability depended primarily on observer and survey date, ranging from 0.34 to 0.94 among observers and from 0.35 to 0.96 across surveys. In the worst-case scenario (i.e., low detectability and low intrinsic occupancy rate), minimum effort for adult Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring in habitat similar to the Albany Pine Bush may require at least 20 habitat patches surveyed 6 times each or at least 10 habitat patches surveyed 8 times each. Less effort (e.g., 10 sites x 4 surveys) will likely suffice if surveys are restricted to the period of peak abundance. Adult occupancy (or patch use) is probably the most efficient state variable for monitoring Frosted Elfin populations, and changes in detection-corrected occupancy rate or proportion of area occupied could be useful for conservation planning.},

Conservation planning is often hampered by the lack of causal quantitative links between landscape characteristics, restoration actions and habitat conditions that impact the status of imperilled species. Here we present a first step toward linking actions on the landscape to the population status of endangered stream-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).
2. We developed relationships between land use, landscape characteristics and freshwater habitat of spring Chinook salmon in the Wenatchee River basin. Available data allowed us to find relationships that described water temperatures at several life stages (prespawning, egg incubation and summer rearing) and substratum characteristics, including fine sediments, cobble and embeddedness. Predictors included altitude, gradient, mean annual precipitation, total and riparian forest cover, road density, impervious surface and alluvium. We used a model averaging approach to account for parameter and model selection uncertainty. Key predictors were total forest cover and impervious surface area for prespawning and summer rearing temperatures; precipitation and stream gradients were important predictors of the percent of fine sediments in stream substrata.
3. We estimated habitat conditions using these relationships in three alternative landscape scenarios: historical, no restoration and one that included a set of restoration actions from local conservation planning. We found that prespawning and summer temperatures were estimated to be slightly higher historically relative to current conditions in dry sparsely forested areas, but lower in some important Chinook salmon spawning and rearing areas and lower in those locations under the restoration scenario. Fine sediments were lower in the historical scenario and were reduced as a consequence of restoration actions in two areas currently unoccupied by Chinook salmon that contain reaches with some potential for high quality spawning and rearing. Cobble and embeddedness in general were predicted to be higher historically and changed little as a result of restoration actions relative to current conditions.
4. This modelling framework converts suites of restoration actions into changes in habitat condition, thereby enabling restoration planners to evaluate alternative combinations of proposed actions. It also provides inputs to models linking habitat conditions to population status. This approach represents a first step in estimating impacts of restoration strategies, and can provide key information for conservation managers and planners.},

A test case is presented for the lagoon of Venice, discussing the results in the context of the application of current EU directives. The effects on food web functioning due to changes related to manageable and unmanageable drivers were investigated. The modelling procedure involved the use of steady-state food web models and network analysis, respectively applied to estimate the fluxes of energy associated with trophic interactions, and to compute indices of food web functioning. On the long term (hundred years) temporal scale, the model indicated that the expected loss of salt marshes will produce further changes at the system level, with a lagoon showing a decrease in the energy processing efficiency. On the short term scale, simulation results indicated that fishery management accompanied by seagrass restoration measures would produce a slight transition towards a more healthy system, with higher energy cycling, and maintaining a good balance between processing efficiency and resilience. Scenarios presented suggest that the effectiveness of short term management strategies can be better evaluated when contextualized in the long term trends of evolution of a system. We also remark the need for further studying the relationship between habitat diversity and indicators of food web functioning. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is a paucity of research on the wider landscape-level effects of ski-piste construction on alpine fauna. In this study, the response of alpine bird communities to the landscape changes induced by the construction of ski-pistes was investigated in the western Italian Alps. The aims were: (i) to test the hypothesis that ski-pistes have a detrimental effect on alpine grassland bird communities at a landscape-scale; and, (ii) to model local probability distributions of bird species according to different scenarios of ski-piste restoration and ski-piste proliferation above the treeline. Species richness and presence/absence data from point counts were analyzed in relation to GIS-derived landscape variables based on a 16 ha hexagon grid. Predictive variables were selected through the LASSO model selection procedure, and logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of occurrence of each species in each hexagon. Grassland species richness, and probability of occurrence of water pipit, wheatear and black redstart, significantly decreased with increasing extent of ski-piste edge. Length of ski-piste edge was in the set of best models considering a large range of habitat and landscape predictors, and are therefore clearly features that exert a strong negative effect on high alpine grassland bird communities. Predictions of species occurrence were made by applying the models to different scenarios of habitat change. These showed predicted detrimental impacts of a relatively small 10\% increase in ski-piste extent, but also that grassland restoration on existing ski-pistes could result in significantly increased occurrence rates of alpine grassland species. This study suggests that ski-pistes are perceived by birds as detrimental features of the alpine landscape. To minimize their impact, new, environmentally-friendly ways of constructing pistes should be developed, which could include habitat restoration and management to obtain a level of grass cover such that edges of ski-pistes are no longer perceived by birds.

In this paper we describe the methodology and results of three such models: those for the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow and the Snail Kite, and the species group model of long-legged wading birds. SESI models are designed to produce relative comparisons of one management alternative to a base scenario or to another alternative. The model outputs do not provide an exact quantitative prediction of future biotic group responses, but rather, when applying the same input data and different hydrologic plans, the models provide the best available means to compare the relative response of the biotic groups. We compared four alternative hydrologic management scenarios to a base scenario (i.e., predicted conditions assuming that current water management practices continue). We ranked the results of the comparisons for each set of models. No one scenario was beneficial to all species; however, they provide a uniform assessment, based on the best available observational information, of relative species responses to alternative water-management plans. As such, these models were used extensively in the restoration planning.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to develop a methodological framework for the management of local eel stocks that integrates habitat restoration with optimal fishery management. The Bolsena lake (Viterbo, Italy) and its emissary, the river Marta, were taken as a reference system. The river flows in the Mediterranean sea but its course is fragmented by a number of dams built in the past century preventing eel migration from and to the sea. Eel fishery in the Bolsena lake is thus sustained by periodic stocking of glass eels caught at the Marta river estuary. A detailed demographic model was applied to simulate fishery yields and potential spawner escapement under different recruitment and management scenarios. It was estimated that the high exploitation rates occurring in the nineties reduced the potential spawner escapement from the Bolsena lake to less than 1 t; under current harvesting rates, the potential spawner escapement is estimated in about 12 t while in pristine conditions (i.e. high recruitment and no fishing) estimated spawner escapement is about 21 t. This analysis thus showed that current fishery management would comply with the 40\% spawner escapement requirement of the EU regulation 1100/2007 if the connections between the Bolsena lake emissary and the sea were fully re-established. This confirms the opportunity of an integrated approach to management at the catchment area level scale for eel populations, that shall hopefully contribute to the conservation of the global stock.},

In many cases the time to success is crucial, and opportunity costs may be greater than direct costs of implementation. We analyse the problem of how to choose between options when risks of failure vary systematically. 2. Ecological uncertainty propagates through to uncertainty about economic outcomes. We used an ecological model of tree recruitment that accounted for uncertainty surrounding the effects of climate and seed fall, coupled with a farm economics model, to examine how a land manager should act when deciding between active and passive revegetation (planting seed/seedlings or relying on natural recruitment, respectively) for restoration purposes on a farm managed for livestock production. 3. The outcome of the analysis was driven by the relative sizes of up-front costs and opportunity costs, which were a function of potential productivity and the time until successful revegetation was achieved. Active revegetation was less costly than passive revegetation in high-productivity situations, because there was less risk of long periods without production and the associated opportunity costs. At low productivity, passive revegetation was less costly than active revegetation. However, because the probability of a successful outcome increased over time, passive revegetation is only likely to be preferred over medium time-frames ({\textgreater} 5 years) and the strategy may not be chosen by risk-averse farmers. 4. Synthesis and applications. This analysis has implications for (i) decision-making by individual land managers and regional planners and (ii) the design of policies for delivery of incentive schemes targeted at revegetation. Risk-averse individual land managers are likely to select active regeneration scenarios, particularly when costs of capital works are shared with the community. For a regional planner, the analysis aids thinking about the probable balance of financial assistance schemes for attaining regional objectives: over high-productivity areas, capital works programmes and short-term opportunity cost incentives ({\textless} 5 years) are cheaper; at low productivity, incentive schemes for medium- to long-term land retirement will be cheaper. This analysis provides a starting point for devising the mix of approaches required to achieve broad-scale revegetation targets, which would include greater investment in uncertain, long-term strategies.},

	abstract = {Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30\% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.},

Ecological simulation models assist in restoring such degraded forests by predicting the effects of alternative management and restoration actions on vegetation structure. However, the lack of empirical ecological data to parameterize models often necessitates the use of expert opinion. Differences in opinion between experts may be large and lead to uncertainty in model predictions, but this is rarely acknowledged in forest simulation models. In this paper, we constructed state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) based on expert opinion to predict whether management will expedite the development of stands with large, old trees - a habitat resource considered critical to forest-dependent biodiversity in the Box-Ironbark forests and woodlands of Victoria, Australia. Three candidate management actions are modified timber harvesting regulations, establishing no-cutting National Parks, and a new ecological thinning prescription. We also investigated the importance of uncertainty caused by differences between experts when constructing STSMs. Model results predict that mature woodlands with large trees will likely not develop sooner with either ecological thinning or modified harvesting than natural development alone, and may lead to a loss of desired vegetation. In addition, differences in model predictions caused by between-expert variation are substantial and can be used to identify biological processes requiring better understanding in this ecosystem.

We simulate a reforestation program in a densely populated locality in central Mexico to analyze indirect land-use change, or leakage, associated with the program and its implications for local livelihoods.
An agent-based, general equilibrium model simulates scenarios that deconstruct the sources of leakage and livelihood outcomes.
Simulations reveal how conditions linking land, labor, and food markets determine the costs and benefits of reforestation and simultaneously the potential for leakage. Leakage is lowest in remote and poorly integrated localities where declining wages foster local food production while discouraging consumption. Since leakage is tied to consumption, there is a trade-off between the program's effectiveness and an equitable outcome.
An ideal strategy could target those localities with few remaining forests, where a program might lead to agricultural intensification rather than expanding the agricultural frontier. Alternatively, the scheme could incorporate remaining forests to avoid deforestation while encouraging reforestation. An uneven distribution of costs and benefits, where some stakeholders may draw benefits from others' losses, could nevertheless set the stage for conflict. Acknowledging these trade-offs should help design a politically feasible program that is effective, efficient, and equitable.},

However, distributions have been restricted by pre-war hunting, and populations are facing issues of natural forest losses caused by new dam constructions and massive conifer plantations. In the present study, we predicted the influences of these environmental conditions on macaque habitats during each season, and evaluated the effect of natural forest restoration as a mitigation measure. We constructed multiple habitat suitability models on the basis of different forest change scenarios, by using maximum entropy modeling (Maxent). We predicted the influence of each scenario by calculating the habitat unit (habitat quality x habitat quantity). We made the following predictions: (1) the influences of environmental conditions on habitat models vary seasonally, but dam construction destroys the optimum macaque habitats in every season; (2) restoration of conifer plantations to semi-natural forests does not always contribute to the improvement of total habitat unit, except in snowy seasons; and (3) in comparison with encouraging natural forest restoration in plantation areas and maintaining the standard-rotation plantation management, the implementation of long-rotation plantation in existing plantation areas provides more suitable alternative habitats for macaques in non-snowy seasons.},

to  the  continued  survival  of  many  species.  We  argue
that,  by  including  spatial  processes  in  restoration
management  plans,  the  effects  of  habitat  loss  and
fragmentation  can  be  offset.  Yet  few  management
plans  take  into  account  spatial  effects  of  habitat  con-
servation/restoration despite the importance of spatial
dynamics in species conservation and recovery plans.
Tilman et al. (1997) found a “restoration lag” in simu-
lations  of  species  restoration  when  randomly  select-
ing  habitat  for  restoration.  Other  studies  have  sug-
gested  that  the  placement  of  restored  habitat  can
overcome  effects  of  habitat  loss  and  fragmentation.
Here we report the findings of simulations that exam-
ine  different  regional  management  strategies,  focus-
ing on habitat selection. We find that nonrandom res-
toration practices such as restoring only habitat that is
adjacent  to  those  occupied  by  the  target  species  can
dramatically  reduce  or  negate  any  restoration  lag.  In
fact,  we  find  that  the  increase  in  patch  occupancy  of
the landscape can be greater than two-fold in the ad-
jacent versus the random scenarios after only two res-
toration  events,  and  this  increase  can  be  as  great  as
six-fold during the early restoration phase. Many res-
toration  efforts  have  limitations  on  both  funds  and
available  sites  for  restoration,  necessitating  high  po-
tential success on any restoration efforts. The incorpo-
ration  of  spatial  analyses  in  restoration  management
may drastically improve a species’ chance of recovery.
Therefore,  general  principles  that  incorporate  spatial
processes  and  sensible  management  are  needed  to
guide specific restoration efforts.},

Recovery from these perturbations is of prime interest to researchers and land managers. We explore how differing regeneration of the coniferous forest to specific disturbances and a shifting climate are mediated through managerial responses, in terms of both species composition and an important ecosystem service, carbon sequestration in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. 112 sites across a variety of disturbance histories were surveyed for post-fire regeneration; carbon stock growth was then simulated in the US Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator under a variety of climate change scenarios for 100 years. Simultaneously, we simulated three managerial responses to the disturbance: no action, planting of local species (resilience-oriented management), and planting of the most climatically suitable species (adaptation-oriented management). These managerial responses simulate varying levels of intervention which attempt to maintain forest properties and associated carbon stocks. Carbon stocks, initially, were more resilient than the coniferous forest system; areas with little coniferous regeneration recovered carbon at a similar pace due to an influx of deciduous seedlings. However, future climate exerts a strong influence on carbon stocks. Both the no-action scenario and the resilience-oriented management scenario transitioned to non-forest by the end of the simulation period, due to climatic changes. Active, adaptation-oriented management, which included establishment of non-local species, maintained forest structure and carbon stocks under most future climate projections, albeit at lower densities. So while this preserves the presence of a forest, it does not preserve the presence of a specific forest. However, for ecosystem services associated with the mere existence of forest cover (e.g., carbon stocks and general forest habitat), this may be sufficient. In a sense, disturbances are opportunities for more climatically-adapted species/communities to establish, although the complexities of assisted migration and novel ecosystems remain.

All planting scenarios were predicted to lead to decreases in daily maximum water temperature after 15-20 years to levels that would be suitable for sensitive invertebrate species. Cooling and reheating were rapid so that most benefits to water temperature along the mainstem were forecast to accrue from shading all of the stream channel network. All planting scenarios were predicted to increase sediment yields over the status quo over the 25-year timeframe examined, with maximal sediment yield occurring about 15 years after planting due to expected erosion of the streambanks under the developing forest shade. Sediment yield was greatest for full catchment planting over 25 years, although sediment yield would be lowest with this scenario over longer timescales. A macroinvertebrate biotic index was predicted to increase by 25\% over 15 years if whole catchment afforestation were implemented, compared to 9\% if only the 4th order mainstem were planted with riparian trees. The use of ecological forecasting to predict likely outcomes for a range of scenarios should prove useful for prioritising rehabilitation actions.},

We implemented published predictive models of average annual acorn production by five oak species common to the eastern United States in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) and used forest inventory data to estimate long-term acorn production on the Bent Creek Experimental Forest watershed, with and without oak decline. Under a no-management scenario, simulations forecasted a 58\% increase in average annual acorn production by 2062 without oak decline but a 17\% decrease with oak decline. Forecasts were influenced by the initial abundance and basal area of different oak species on the landscape and stand dynamics over time. Simulations indicated that heavy oak mortality with regeneration failure could substantially affect acorn production over the long term by reducing the proportion of mature canopy oaks and relative abundance of oak species. FVS ACORN provides a powerful tool for long-term acorn production planning that can be tailored to individual landscapes and forest management scenarios to predict average annual number and mass of acorns.},

	abstract = {A strategy for recovering endangered species during climate change is to restore ecosystem processes that moderate effects of climate shifts. In mid-latitudes, storm patterns may shift their intensity, duration, and frequency. These shifts threaten flooding in human communities and reduce migration windows (conditions suitable for migration after a storm) for fish. Rehabilitation of historic floodplains can in principle reduce these threats via transient storage of storm water, but no one has quantified the benefit of floodplain rehabilitation for migrating fish, a widespread biota with conservation and economic value. We used simple models to quantify migration opportunity for a threatened migratory fish, steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), in an episodic rain-fed river system, the Pajaro River in central California. We combined flow models, bioenergetic models, and existing climate projections to estimate the sensitivity of migration windows to altered storm patterns under alternate scenarios of floodplain rehabilitation. Generally, migration opportunities were insensitive to warming, weakly sensitive to duration or intensity of storms, and proportionately sensitive to frequency of storms. The rehabilitation strategy expanded migration windows by 16-28\% regardless of climate outcomes. Warmer conditions raised the energy cost of migrating, but not enough to matter biologically. Novel findings were that fewer storms appeared to pose a bigger threat to migrating steelhead than warmer or smaller storms and that floodplain rehabilitation lessened the risk from fewer or smaller storms across all plausible hydroclimatic outcomes. It follows that statistical downscaling methods may mischaracterize risk, depending on how they resolve overall precipitation shifts into changes of storm frequency as opposed to storm size. Moreover, anticipating effects of climate shifts that are irreducibly uncertain (here, rainfall) may be more important than anticipating effects of relatively predictable changes such as warming. This highlights a need to credibly identify strategies of ecosystem rehabilitation that are robust to uncertainty.

The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species. The greatest positive effect is obtained if forests located close to the existing remnants of biologically diverse forests are restored, which would facilitate the migration of target species to the restored forests.},

Conservation concerns for ocelots include loss of dense thornshrub habitat, mortality from ocelot-vehicle collisions, and genetic erosion. In this study, we used a population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate four recovery strategies (i.e., supplementation of additional ocelots, reduced road mortality, habitat protection and restoration, and linkage of two breeding populations) for ocelot conservation management. We used the VORTEX (Version 9.42) program to conduct our PVA for an ocelot population located in Cameron County, Texas. Each scenario was simulated 500 times over 100 years. We compared the effectiveness of recovery strategies and combinations thereof with estimates of extinction probability and final population size. Model scenarios with no recovery strategies predicted an extinction probability of 0.65 for the Cameron population of ocelots over 100 years. The protection and restoration of thornshrub habitat was the most effective recovery strategy, followed by population linkage and reduced road mortality, with the supplementation of ocelots being the least effective strategy. Protection and restoration of ocelot habitat cannot be accomplished without the participation of private landowners. Using an adaptive management approach, future actions need to be taken to monitor ocelot populations and habitats and help to reduce the high probability of extinction predicted in our PVA for the ocelot population in Cameron County.

We use a policy optimization routine to identify fishing patterns that maximize economic, social, and ecological benefits from the restored historic systems. The ecosystem models are subjected to simulated harvest under optimal fishing plans, and the most beneficial scenarios are identified through various economic, social, and ecological indices. Knowing what a restored system may be worth to stakeholders could help us to justify the costs of whole ecosystem restoration. The 1750 ecosystem emerges as the most desirable restoration goal, owing to its large biomass of valuable target species. It is able to deliver the greatest sustainable benefits in terms of fisheries rent and employment, while sacrificing less biodiversity per dollar harvested. The 1900 period is slightly less attractive in all regards. The 2000 system offers superior benefits to 1950 in terms of potential rent and jobs, though not biodiversity. Ecosystem models have data deficiencies, and parameter uncertainty can compromise optimal harvest predictions. The problem is amplified when we reach into the past, where data for even the most visible species may come from anecdotal accounts. EwE provides a capacity to deal with data uncertainty; here we test ecosystem effects of our optimal harvest policies given unsure initial biomass estimates. Poor quality input data and/or heavy exploitation rates lead to large variations in the predicted structure of the ecosystem following optimal harvests.},

To compare the relative benefits of typical habitat restoration actions on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), we modelled the response of an endangered Columbia River Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) population to changes in habitat characteristics either targeted for restoration or with the potential to be degraded. 2. We applied a spatially explicit, multiple life stage, Beverton-Holt model to evaluate how a set of habitat variables with an empirical influence on spring-run Chinook salmon survivorship influenced fish population abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity. Using habitat condition scenarios - historical conditions and future conditions with restoration, no restoration, and degradation - we asked the following questions: (i) how is population status affected by alternative scenarios of habitat change, (ii) which individual habitat characteristics have the potential to substantially influence population status and (iii) which life stages have the largest impact on population status? 3. The difference in population abundance and productivities resulting from changes in modelled habitat variables from the 'historical' to 'current' scenarios suggests that there is substantial potential for improving population status. Planned restoration actions directed toward modelled variables, however, produced only modest improvements. 4. The model predicted that population status could be improved by additional restoration efforts directed toward further reductions in the percentage of fine sediments in the streambed, a factor that has a large influence on egg survival. Actions reducing fines were predicted to be especially effective outside the national forest that covers most of the basin. Scenarios that increased capacity by opening access to habitat in good condition also had a positive but smaller effect on spawner numbers. 5. Degradation in habitat quality, particularly in percent fine sediments, within stream reaches located in the national forest had great potential to further reduce this population's viability. This finding supports current forest planning efforts to minimise road density and clear-cut harvests and to return forest stand structure in dry regions to the historical condition that promoted frequent low-intensity fires rather than catastrophic stand-replacing fires, as these landscape factors have been shown to influence percent fine sediment in streams. 6. Together, these results suggest that planning focusing on protecting currently good habitat, reducing fine sediments to promote egg survival and increasing spawner capacity will be beneficial to endangered spring-run Chinook population status.},

	abstract = {The intention of the paper is an evaluation of the restoration potential of the Spree-Havel River system for rheophilic and anadromous fish species. The European sturgeon Acipenser sturio was used as an indicator species in the Spree-Havel River system, focusing on the effects of providing longitudinal passage: (Scenario 1), and two possibilities for spawning site restoration (Scenario 2=altered flow conditions below weirs and gravel addition, and Scenario 3=fundamental riverbed modification to create spawning habitats). To determine the effects on population development, an age-structured population model for A.sturio was used. Targets of the study were to predict potential effects of a Havel population on the Elbe River population, as well as to assess the effects of restoration and connectivity on the fish assemblage of the Spree-Havel system, with special reference to the goals of the EU Flora-Fauna-Habitat Directive and the EU Water Framework Directive. The paucity of sturgeon caught in the Spree-Havel River system during the 19th century indicates that alterations to the river system (mill weirs, flow alterations and communal wastes input) contributed to a significant population decrease. Restoration of the river connectivity alone will have little effect on its potential to support a sturgeon population without moderate improvements to the hydro-morphology and habitat structures (scenario 2=restoration of 30\% of the potential habitats, resulting in 30000m(2) of spawning habitat). This approach would increase the population potential dramatically when combined with the reestablishment of longitudinal connectivity up to Neuendorf Lake, which would reopen 220km of river passage. As a result, the sturgeon population in the river system could contribute an estimated 41\% to the potential total Elbe River population. The Spree-Havel system has an estimated support potential of between 15400 and 42000 juvenile fish during out-migration from the system and 4300-11700 spawners for an annual return. Results of the modeling study confirm that the main restrictions to reach the WFD goals are associated with the lack of hydro-morphological and hydro-dynamic diversity in adjacent river stretches.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem restoration in south Florida is a state and national priority centered on the Everglades wetlands. However, urban development pressures affect the restoration potential and remaining habitat functions of the natural undeveloped areas. Land use (LU) planning often focuses at the local level, but a better understanding of the cumulative effects of small projects at the landscape level is needed to support ecosystem restoration and preservation. The South Florida Ecosystem Portfolio Model (SFL EPM) is a regional LU planning tool developed to help stakeholders visualize LU scenario evaluation and improve communication about regional effects of LU decisions. One component of the SFL EPM is ecological value (EV), which is evaluated through modeled ecological criteria related to ecosystem services using metrics for (1) biodiversity potential, (2) threatened and endangered species, (3) rare and unique habitats, (4) landscape pattern and fragmentation, (5) water quality buffer potential, and (6) ecological restoration potential. In this article, we demonstrate the calculation of EV using two case studies: (1) assessing altered EV in the Biscayne Gateway area by comparing 2004 LU to potential LU in 2025 and 2050, and (2) the cumulative impact of adding limestone mines south of Miami. Our analyses spatially convey changing regional EV resulting from conversion of local natural and agricultural areas to urban, industrial, or extractive use. Different simulated local LU scenarios may result in different alterations in calculated regional EV. These case studies demonstrate methods that may facilitate evaluation of potential future LU patterns and incorporate EV into decision making.},

	abstract = {For marine fish and invertebrates, larval dispersal plays a critical role in determining connections among source and sink habitats, and the lack of a predictive understanding of larval dispersal is a fundamental obstacle to the development of spatially explicit restoration plans for marine populations. We investigated larval dispersal patterns of eastern oyster in an estuary along the Northern Gulf of Mexico under different simulation scenarios of tidal amplitude and phase, river discharge, wind direction, and larval vertical migration, using a coupled biophysical transport model. We focused on the dispersal of larvae released from the commercially exploited (Cedar Point, CP) and non-exploited (Bon Secour Bay, BSB) oyster populations. We found that high flushing rates through the dominant inlet prevented larval exchange between the commercially exploited and non-exploited populations, resulting in negligible connectivity between them. Variations in tidal amplitude, river discharge and wind direction played a more important role in the amount of larvae retained in Mobile Bay when they are released from CP than from BSB. Under most of the scenarios, larvae from BSB were retained around the spawning area, while larvae from CP showed a predominant westward flow. Net sinking behavior of late-stage larvae increased larval retention in the bay, but physical transport showed a higher impact in the amount of larvae retained. These findings have enhanced our understanding of larval dispersal of eastern oyster in a wide, shallow estuarine system, and been used to establish spatially explicit strategies for oyster restoration in the Mobile Bay system, Alabama.},

We conducted a seeding experiment on an arid (15.4cm rain/year), historically heavily-grazed rangeland in Northern Arizona to test the effects of seeding technique and simulated seasonal climate scenarios on germination and recruitment of four species of native, cool-season bunchgrasses: Achnatherum hymenoides, Hesperostipa comata, Poa secunda, and Elymus elymoides. Initial results indicated that C3 grasses germinated significantly more in drill-seeded treatments under simulated high precipitation years than in other treatment types. Five years post-treatment, P. secunda and E. elymoides were not observed but simulated drill-seeded treatments, had significantly higher densities of A. hymenoides and H.comata recruits relative to most other treatment types. Simulated drill seeding also increased soil disturbance which increased the establishment of the invasive weed Salsola tragus in year 1, but not thereafter. Although it appears critical to coordinate effective seeding techniques with high winter-spring precipitation, predicting such events may not be possible at some sites, suggesting that seeding low elevation, arid rangelands of the Colorado Plateau may not always be realistic under a future climate that is drier and less predictable.},

We modeled the effects of three destratification scenarios (non-, low-, and high-mixing) using both physical and biological models. Field observations were used to calibrate the models. Water temperatures estimated from 18 unique DYRESM simulations were used in a bioenergetics model to estimate growth of five age classes of rainbow smelt under normal and destratified conditions. Our simulations indicate that destratification can eliminate optimal rainbow smelt thermal habitat resulting in mortality. Destratified lake temperatures also surpassed several physiological critical temperatures. Bioenergetics simulations predicted a weight loss of 45-55\% in yearling and adult rainbow smelt. We found that destratification is potentially effective for eradicating cold-water species in temperate lakes.},

	abstract = {Water  operations  policy  to  support  improved  habitat  for  riparian  and  aquatic  species  is  being 
implemented in many regions of the United States. Habitat - motivated outcomes include surface and groundwater
hydrology metrics. The desired hydrological outcomes include specific seasonal hydrographs to support spawning
and other fish needs; and, overbank flooding or maintenance of shallow groundwater conditions to support native
riparian vegetation, providing nesting habitat or serving other ecological functions. Success  in achieving surface
water and groundwater metrics is dependent on multiple concurrent interactions, not only between surface water
and groundwater within the hydrogeological setting of the near-river zone, i.e. river gains and losses, but also on
evapotranspiration, which varies by plant group, season, and depth to groundwater; and, on regional groundwater
boundary conditions, which may be influenced by climate, urban, or irrigation demand. Finally, the river bed itself
may undergo change under different flow regimes, and present further uncertainty in extrapolating from historic
hydrological  relationship s  to  future  conditions.  To  improve  understanding  of  hydrological  relationships  in  the
near-river  zone  and  assess  impacts  of  water  operation  alternatives  on  ecology-based  hydrological  metrics,  a
modelling approach has been developed that incorporates transient processes that potentially impact groundwater
conditions and groundwater–surface water interactions. This approach has been applied to the evaluation of river
restoration  and  water  operation  alternatives  on  the  Rio  Grande  in  New  Mexico  and  the  San  Joaq
uin  River  in California, USA. Very high-resolution three-dimensional groundwater models are employed, with  the width  and
depth  of  wetted  river  channel  and  flooded  overbank  areas  set  as  flow-dependent  boundary  conditions,  obtained
from  a  companion  surface  water  routing  model.  To  incorporate  variable  water  demand  by  vegetation,  riparian
plant   functional   groups   are   identified   that   can   be   separately   assigned   potential   evapotranspiration   rates,
seasonally-varying  rates  of  water  use,  and  rooting  depths.  External transient  processes,  such  as  regional  water
demand, that impact the near-river groundwater zone are specified according to a hypothesized future condition.
Model simulations illustrate the sensitivity of desired hydrological metrics to other elements of the ecosystem, and
demonstrate  the  need  to  evaluate  possible  future  scenarios  not  against  static  assumptions  drawn  from  past
observed conditions, but in light of physically-based transient system dynamics.},

Such an approach is useful when predictions cannot be validated empirically; however, evaluating the sensitivity of scenario-based approaches to key uncertainties is necessary so that managers understand how real-world constraints might impact results. We used a simulation approach to investigate the sensitivity of freshwater habitat restoration plans to spatial pattern (e.g., project locations) and economic uncertainties (e.g., budget level and project costs) in a case study on Pacific salmon in the Lewis River Basin (WA, U.S.A.). We found that some evaluation metrics performed better when restoration was distributed randomly, whereas others improved more when restoration occurred on contiguous stretches of river. Subwatersheds responded differently to restoration, suggesting that intrinsic characteristics limit restoration potential. Changes in budget usually caused proportionate improvements in habitat but disproportionate fish responses, suggesting a cumulative benefit for fish. Most per-dollar benefits increased as project cost decreased; therefore, model predictions are sensitive to project cost. Simulation analyses provided increased information about how economics and spatial pattern might affect habitats and salmon; these insights can help policymakers identify an appropriate restoration strategy.},

	abstract = {Mesquite and similar woody plant species occupy over 28 million hectares in the southwestern USA and often negatively affect the rural economic sector by reducing livestock forage production, increasing bare ground, and interfering with livestock handling. Current control methods that temporarily suppress the growth of these woody plants include herbicide sprays, mechanical treatments, and prescribed fire. One alternative to current control practices is to utilize mesquite biomass for electricity generation. This study examined the economic feasibility of mesquite biomass as a potential bioenergy feedstock for electricity production using a Faustmann-type model with five mesquite biomass accumulation scenarios, which take into account variations in rates of standing biomass accumulation and tree density reestablishment after harvest with the aboveground-only (AG) harvest option or the whole-plant (WP) harvest option. The estimated regrowth functions were then incorporated into a modified version of the Faustmann model to determine the optimal harvesting length of mesquite that maximizes the net present value of a power plant using mesquite biomass. Results indicated that mesquite biomass has economic potential to be a source for electricity generation. A long-term bioenergy harvest system with regrowth following AG harvest was much more cost-effective than reestablishment from germination of new seedlings after WP harvest, even though harvest cost is higher in the AG than that in the WP harvest option. In addition, the utilization of mesquite for bioenergy would enhance other more traditional income streams from these lands including livestock grazing and wildlife hunting leases (with patterned harvesting of mesquite) and would reduce herbicide or mechanical costs that ordinarily are necessary for woody plant control. Compared to conventional coal, a lower economic return was found when the mesquite biomass was used for electricity production, but a possible carbon emission tax would make mesquite biomass competitive with conventional coal.},

	abstract = {We considered how Lake Okeechobee, a large shallow lake in Florida, USA, might respond to altered hydrology associated with climate change scenarios in 2060. Water budgets and stage hydrographs were provided from the South Florida Water Management Model, a regional hydrologic model used to develop plans for Everglades restoration. Future scenarios include a 10 \% increase or decrease in rainfall (RF) and a calculated increase in evapotranspiration (ET), which is based on a 1.5 A degrees C rise in temperature. Increasing RF and ET had counter-balancing effects on the water budget and when changing concurrently did not affect hydrology. In contrast, when RF decreased while ET increased, this resulted in a large change in hydrology. The surface elevation of the lake dropped by more than 2 m under this scenario compared to a future base condition, and extreme low elevation persisted for multiple years. In this declining RF/increasing ET scenario, the littoral and near-shore zones, areas that support emergent and submerged plants, were dry 55 \% of the time compared to less than 4 \% of the time in the future base run. There also were times when elevation increased as much as 3 m after intense RF events. Overall, these changes in hydrologic conditions would dramatically alter ecosystem services. Uncertainty about responses is highest at the pelagic-littoral interface, in regard to whether an extremely shallow lake could support submerged vascular plants, which are critical to the recreational fishery and for migratory birds. Along with improved regional climate modeling, research in that interface zone is needed to guide the adaptive process of Everglades restoration.},

	abstract = {The EPA’s multimedia environmental pathway model, Prediction of Radiological Effects due to Shallow Trench Operation (PRESTO), has been applied extensively to scenarios involving both the remediation of soil contaminated with radioactivity and the near-surface disposal of radioactive waste. Designed primarily for regulatory applications, the model can estimate both the individual dose and risk for a critical population group and the collective health effects to a general population. This paper presents the theoretical background of PRESTO’s dynamic infiltration component. The simulation of infiltration involves solving the dynamic equations that govern the transport of liquid and vapor phases of water in the overland flow, subsurface flow, and atmospheric diffusion systems. The basic space-dependent partial differential equations that describe these processes are transformed into space-independent ordinary differential equations; this entails subdividing the soil moisture content into three components: gravity, pellicular, and hygroscopic waters. Modeling validation, as assessed at the Barnwell, S.C. site, indicates that the simulation results agree well with field studies conducted by the USGS and by the US NRC. Tests and validation runs have demonstrated that: (1) the calculation results can simulate infiltration through a saturated/unsaturated subsurface soil layer, (2) instabilities of numerical calculation do not occur, and (3) the run time for model execution is reasonably short. Because of lack of reliable field data, the model can only be verified and not fully validated.},

	abstract = {Lambeck (Conservation Biology 11: 849 - 856, 1997) proposed a multi-species approach for defining the landscape attributes and management practices required to meet the conservation requirements of biota. The suite of species which are identified as being most sensitive to a range of threats are termed the 'focal' species. The critical requirements with respect to each threat are used to define the amount and configuration of habitats that must be present in the landscape. We briefly review the application of the approach in the temperate agricultural zones of eastern and Western Australia. To date, the application of the approach has generally been limited to a reduced set of threats and primarily one taxonomic group - sedentary woodland and shrubland birds. Insufficient habitat patch size, isolation, lack of connectivity, and degraded patch quality (e.g., loss of understorey) have been the key threatening processes analysed through the focal species approach. The approach has been used to develop spatially explicit revegetation guidelines and landscape enhancement scenarios for various non-government organisations and farmer groups actively involved in management of native vegetation. We conclude that the focal species approach is a useful starting point for nature conservation in that it provides explicit recommendations rather than general principles. The approach allows the transparent and repeatable derivation of spatially explicit predictions for at least a single broad taxon such as sedentary woodland birds. We see the approach as simply one of many tools needed to prioritise and guide conservation efforts at a range of scales.},

	abstract = {Ecological models can act as interesting tools to support decision-making in river restoration management. In particular models which are capable of predicting the habitat requirements of species are of considerable importance to ensure that the planned actions have the desired effects on the aquatic ecosystem. To this end, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were tested and optimized for the prediction of the habitat suitability for Gammarus pulex, a relevant indicator species in water quality assessment. Although ANN models are in general quite robust with a rather high predictive reliability, the model performance had to be increased with regard to simulations for river restoration management. In particular, it has been shown that spatial and temporal expert-rules could possibly be included. Migration dynamics of downstream drift and upstream migration of the organisms and migration barriers along the river (weirs, culverted river sections,...) might indeed deliver important additional information on the effectiveness of the restoration plans, and also on the timing of the expected effects. In this context, an additional in-stream migration model for Gammarus pulex was developed. This migration model, implemented in a Geographical Information System (GIS), has been used to simulate a practical river restoration scenario for a river in Flanders, Belgium. The case study illustrated that the removal of a weir, at a particular site, resulted in the improvement of the habitat suitability for Gammarus pulex. The ANN models predicted that after restoration the habitat was suitable again for Gammarus pulex. The migration model indicated that the restored parts of the river would be recolonized within about 2 months. In this way, decision makers can have an idea whether and when a restoration option will have a desired effect.},

	abstract = {Identifying good investments in environmental management is complex as several prioritization strategies may be used and significant uncertainty often surrounds cost, benefits, and agency budgets. In this paper I developed a model for robust portfolio selection based on preference programming to support cost-effective environmental investment decisions under uncertainty and applied it to the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin. Benefits and costs of 46 investment alternatives (called targets) for managing natural capital and ecosystem services were quantified and the associated uncertainty estimated. Thirty-six investment portfolios were selected using mathematical programming under four investment prioritization strategies (cost-effectiveness (E-max), cost-effectiveness including a suite of pre-committed (or core) costs (E-max*), cost-only (C-rank), and benefit-only (B-rank)), three decision rules (pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic), and three budget scenarios (minimum, most likely, maximum). Compared to the optimally performing investment strategy E-max, the E-max* and C-rank strategies only slightly reduced portfolio performance and altered portfolio composition. However, the B-rank strategy reduced performance by half and radically changed composition. Uncertainty in costs, benefits, and available budgets also strongly influenced portfolio performance and composition. I conclude that in this case study the consideration of uncertainty was at least as important as investment strategy in effective environmental decision-making. Targets whose selection was less sensitive to uncertainty were identified as more robust investments. The results have informed the allocation of AU\$69 million in the study area and the techniques are readily adaptable to similar conservation and environmental investment decisions in other areas at a variety of scales.

	abstract = {American shad Alosa sapidissima are in decline in their native range, andmodeling possible management scenarios could help guide their restoration. We developed a density-dependent, deterministic, stage-based matrix model to predict the population-level results of transporting American shad to suitable spawning habitat upstream of dams on the Roanoke River, North Carolina and Virginia. We used data on sonic-tagged adult American shad and oxytetracycline-marked American shad fry both above and below dams on the Roanoke River with information from other systems to estimate a starting population size and vital rates. We modeled the adult female population over 30 years under plausible scenarios of adult transport, effective fecundity (egg production), and survival of adults (i.e., to return to spawn the next year) and juveniles (from spawned egg to age 1). We also evaluated the potential effects of increased survival for adults and juveniles. The adult female population size in the Roanoke River was estimated to be 5,224. With no transport, the model predicted a slow population increase over the next 30 years. Predicted population increases were highest when survival was improved during the first year of life. Transport was predicted to benefit the population only if high rates of effective fecundity and juvenile survival could be achieved. Currently, transported adults and young are less likely to successfully out-migrate than individuals below the dams, and the estimated adult population size is much smaller than either of two assumed values of carrying capacity for the lower river; therefore, transport is not predicted to help restore the stock under present conditions. Research on survival rates, density-dependent processes, and the impacts of structures to increase out-migration success would improve evaluation of the potential benefits of access to additional spawning habitat for American shad.},

However, the lack of high-quality data derived from long-term studies, and uncertainty in model parameters and/or structure, often limit the use of population models to only a few species of conservation concern. We used spatially explicit metapopulation models in conjunction with multi-criteria decision analysis to assess how species-specific threats and management interventions would affect the persistence of African wild dog, black rhino, cheetah, elephant, leopard and lion, under six reserve scenarios, thereby providing the basis for deciding on a best course of conservation action in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, which forms the central component of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot. Overall, the results suggest that current strategies of managing populations within individual, small, fenced reserves are unlikely to enhance metapopulation persistence should catastrophic events affect populations in the future. Creating larger and better-connected protected areas would ensure that threats can be better mitigated in the future for both African wild dog and leopard, which can disperse naturally, and black rhino, cheetah, elephant, and lion, which are constrained by electric fences but can be managed using translocation. The importance of both size and connectivity should inform endangered megafauna conservation and management, especially in the context of restoration efforts in increasingly human-dominated landscapes.},

Western Cape of South Africa. The Groot Drakenstein. Franschhoek and Jonkershoek mountains receives more rainfall than the surrounding areas and is an important source of water for the city of Cape Town. The costs of alien invasive plant removal, gully-erosion repair and reseeding with indigenous plants are considered in a case-study cost-benefit analysis of restoration, in terms of the water and tourism benefits derived. Three different options of restoration (comprehensive, moderate. basic) were analysed under three different economic scenarios (optimistic. realistic, pessimistic) and the costs of which have been weighted up against the income derived from the supply of water and tourism. The results have shown that despite the high costs of restoration. the basic restoration option costs were out-weighed by the water and tourism benefits derived. This was also true of the moderate restoration option, when evaluated under the optimistic scenario and using an 8\% discount rate, or a 3\% discount rate under any scenario. However, this was not the case in the moderate restoration option when using an 8\% discount rate in conjunction with the realistic and pessimistic scenarios. Neither was it the case when using a 12\% discount rate, irrespective of the scenario. Under no scenario was the cost of a comprehensive restoration option outweighed by the benefits quantified, irrespective of the discount rate used. It was concluded that further restoration, in addition to the mere clearing of alien invasive plants, would be economically viable under certain assumptions and conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a Leslie matrix model for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that specifies transitions among spawning nests (redds), streams, tidal deltas, nearshore habitats, and the ocean, we compared the relative importance of different habitats under three density-dependent scenarios: juvenile density independence, density-dependent mortality within streams, delta, and nearshore, and density-dependent migration among streams, delta, and nearshore. Each scenario assumed density dependence during spawning. We examined how these scenarios influenced priorities for habitat restoration using a set of hypothetical watersheds whose habitat areas could be systematically varied, as well as the Duwamish and Skagit rivers. In all watersheds, the three scenarios shared high sensitivity to changes in in nearshore and ocean mortality and produced similar responses to changes in other parameters controlling mortality (i.e., habitat quality). However, the three scenarios exhibited striking variation in population response to changes in habitat area (i.e., capacity). These findings indicate that nearshore habitat relationships may play significant roles for salmon populations and that the relative importance of restoring habitat area will depend on the mechanism of density dependence influencing salmon stocks.},

	abstract = {In Australia, as in many countries, there has been a shift in timber production from native forests to plantations. While plantations are primarily considered an efficient means of producing timber, there is increasing interest in their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation. Plantations may have both positive and negative consequences for biodiversity, at a range of scales. We compiled a list of these consequences from the literature, and used them to assess plantation scenarios proposed for cleared rainforest landscapes in tropical and subtropical Australia. The scenarios were monocultures of: (i) hoop pine, (ii) exotic pine and (iii) eucalypts; (iv) mixed species plantations; (v) a mosaic of monoculture plantations; and (vi) a mosaic of plantations and ecological restoration plantings. Of these scenarios, plantations of eucalypts and exotic pines have the least positive consequences for biodiversity: they have little or no intrinsic value in rainforest landscapes, provide poor quality habitat for rainforest biota, and (particularly eucalypts) are characterised by a relatively open canopy which in cleared landscapes favours the recruitment of grasses and other weeds. The three scenarios based on plantations of rainforest trees have similar, moderately positive consequences for biodiversity, while a mosaic of plantations and restoration plantings has the most positive consequences for biodiversity in cleared rainforest landscapes. All scenarios may have negative impacts on biodiversity conservation if plantations replace remnant forest, provide habitat for weeds, or the tree species used in plantations or their genes escape into native forests. In practice, the relative importance of positive and negative impacts, and hence the ranking of scenarios may vary with landscape forest cover. Scenarios with strongly positive consequences for biodiversity would be favoured for the reforestation of heavily cleared landscapes, whereas scenarios with few negative consequences for biodiversity would be favoured in well-forested landscapes. Consequently, any plantation of rainforest trees may have acceptable consequences for biodiversity in well-forested landscapes, provided the trees are not invasive or carrying exotic genotypes, and plantations are managed to control weeds and feral animals. With the same caveats, plantations of exotic pines may also be acceptable from a biodiversity conservation perspective in well-forested landscapes. At present, our capacity to design and manage rainforest plantations for both timber and biodiversity objectives is limited by a lack of information on factors affecting timber production, biodiversity values and trade-offs or synergies between these objectives. Obtaining this information will require the integration of large-scale, long-term biodiversity research in broadscale plantation projects.},

	abstract = {An existing Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model for the Central North Pacific was updated and modified to focus on the area used by the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery. The EwE model was combined with output from a coupled NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory climate and biogeochemical model to investigate the likely ecosystem impacts of fishing and climate-induced primary productivity changes. Four simulations were conducted based on 2 fishing effort and climate scenarios from 2010 to 2100. Modeled small and large phytoplankton biomass decreased by 10 \% and 20 \% respectively, resulting in a 10 \% decline in the total biomass of all higher trophic level groups combined. Climate impacts also affected the Hawaii longline fishery, with a 25–29 \% reduction in modeled target species yield. Climate impacts on the ecosystem and the fishery were partially mitigated by a drop in fishing effort. Scenarios with a 50 \% reduction in fishing effort partially restored longline target species yield to current levels, and decreased longline non-target species yield. These model results suggest that a further reduction in fishery landings mortality over time than the 2010 level may be necessary to mitigate climate impacts and help sustain yields of commercially preferred fish species targeted by the Hawaii longline fishery through the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Preservation of biodiversity is a central goal of conservation management, yet the conditions that promote persistence may differ for the species in the community. For systems subject to stochastic disturbances such as fire, understanding which management practices promote persistence for all species in a community is complex. Before deciding on the best course of action, an objective must be specified. Yet an overarching goal of species persistence can be specified into a measureable objective many different ways. We investigated four alternative management objectives for maximizing species persistence that use common biodiversity indices: (1) attaining the minimally acceptable mix of successional vegetation states to support species' relative abundances, (2) maximizing the arithmetic mean abundance of species, (3) maximizing the geometric mean abundance of species, and (4) minimizing the average extinction risk of species. We used stochastic dynamic programming to model successional changes in vegetation in the presence of both planned and unplanned fires, and utilize an extensive data set on the occurrence of birds, reptiles, and small mammals in different successional states in semiarid Australia. We investigated the influence the choice of objective function and taxonomic focus has on the optimal fire management recommendations. We also evaluated a recent hazard reduction policy to annually burn a fixed amount of the landscape and compare results to the optimal solution. The optimal management strategy to maximize species persistence over a 100-year period is predominantly to minimize wildfires. This is because the majority of species are more likely to occur in intermediate and late successional vegetation. However the optimal solution showed sensitivity to the objective and the species included in the analysis. These results highlight the need for careful consideration when specifying an objective to represent overarching conservation goals. Using the extinction risk objective, we show that a policy to annually burn 5\% of the landscape could increase the average probability of extinction for the modelled species by 7\% over the next 100 years compared to the optimal management scenario.},

	abstract = {To ensure the long-term survival of its most valuable and threatened habitats, the European Union (EU) is committing its Member States to develop a network of protected areas. Flanders (northern Belgium) is a highly urbanised region, where natural environments are scarce. Policy-makers are converting existing forest plantations (mostly former coniferous plantations) into natural areas to comply with the EU requirements about nature restoration and satisfy the growing demand for recreation and amenity spaces.
The conversion of forest plantations into higher value nature, however, sometimes meets public opposition because it often involves clearcuts and landscape modification. Regional planning authorities are looking for case studies demonstrating which type of nature restoration is valued and thus supported by citizens. Past valuation studies show that personal, site-specific and spatial characteristics influence preferences. However, little is known about the relative importance of such factors.
We conduct a discrete choice experiment to investigate preferences for nature restoration scenarios that involve forest conversion. A mixed logit and a latent class model are estimated and the influence of socio-demographic characteristics is explored. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates are elicited. Though people generally prefer the forest habitat type, our results suggest that public support exists for converting forest plantations if this contributes to increasing landscape diversity and species richness. Based on our findings, we recommend small scale cuts. This in order to gently open the landscape, assist the natural regeneration process and help current species adapt to that landscape modification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The number of fish habitat improvement schemes has greatly increased in response to the widespread degradation of aquatic ecosystems. However, many of these enhancement projects often fail to create expected habitat conditions, because they are rarely planned and executed with inputs from the species' habitat requirements throughout their life histories, and it is frequently assumed that the implementation of a specific instream structure for habitat improvement will always benefit all species present. Using a 2D hydraulic model, the present study evaluates the potential habitat improvement for two critically endangered fish species-the Southwestern arched-mouth nase Iberochondrostoma almacai and the Arade chub Squalius aradensis-resulting from simulating the introduction of different instream structures (islands, lateral bays, and deflectors) in a modified Mediterranean river reach. The introduction of islands in the river channel was found to be the best improvement measure for YOY and juvenile nase and chub, as shown by increases in the mean annual Weighted Usable Area (WUA) of more than 100 and 50\%, respectively, compared to the present conditions. On the other hand, the simulation with current deflectors proved to be the worst scenario, particularly for nase, with mean annual WUA decreasing by 3.6, 17.8 and 22.7\% for YOY, juveniles and adults, respectively. The findings of this study point to the need to account for different species life-history stages when modelling the implementation of instream structures for habitat improvement and also provide a sound basis for future conservation-related studies conducted in Mediterranean rivers that harbour other threatened "sister" species.},

These forests are the optimal habitat of the black and white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), an endemic endangered primate species. A graph-based approach is used for modeling the ecological network of this species and analyzing connectivity across several spatio-temporal scales, from daily movements to dispersal events. The aims of this paper are (1) to assess the impact of an existing highway by comparing connectivity with and without the infrastructure; (2) to assess the potential improvement of connectivity induced by diverting traffic from the highway to a tunnels/viaducts section under construction; (3) to compare several mitigation scenarios with potential reforestation measures. The analysis is carried out both at the global level to quantify changes in the overall connectivity at several distances and, at the local level to identify which parts of the network are the most vulnerable. The results show that the highway has a low effect (-33\%) on connectivity at the daily scale, but that increased gradually with distance (up to -21.5\% for the largest), however habitat loss is only -0.1\%. Some of the affected habitat patches are located 30 km north of the highway. The three mitigation scenarios have a different impact on connectivity. The third scenario leading to the creation of new habitat patches is the only one that strongly increases connectivity at several scales. This kind of graph approach can improve assessment of the impact of constructing a given infrastructure by taking into account the different scales of ecological processes and so can better target conservation measures for impacted species, here the emblematic, endangered, Yunnan snub-nosed monkey.

This work is the second part of a paper (Hussein et al., 2011) which describes the parameterization of the model. Here we carry out a sensitivity analysis to identify the most significant model parameters. The simulation results show that the model is particularly sensitive to some parameters such as natural mortality, stage length, fecundity, number of inactive days per strategy and gear standardisation factors. Second, the impact of several management measures was evaluated (e.g. marine protected areas (MPAs) in the nursery and spawning zones, changes in gillnet mesh size and fishing effort reduction). Management scenarios were then assessed and compared using a simulation design. The results indicate that the permanent closures in the white seabream juvenile habitat for all gears, a change in gillnet mesh size and fishing effort reduction would result in an important increase in the population biomass and catch. The closures of the spawning zones appear inefficient in restoring D. sargus biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The BERA was in response to a release of 4.1 million m(3) of coal ash on December 22, 2008. It used multiple lines of evidence to assess risks for 17 different ecological receptors to approximately 400000m(3) of residual ash in the Emory and Clinch rivers. Here, we provide a brief overview of the BERA results and then focus on how the results were used to help shape risk management decisions. Those decisions included selecting monitored natural recovery for remediation of the residual ash in the Emory and Clinch rivers and designing a long-term monitoring plan that includes adaptive management principles for timely adjustment to changing conditions. This study demonstrates the importance of site-specific ecological data (e.g., tissue concentrations for food items, reproductive data, and population data) in complex ecological risk assessments. It also illustrates the value of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) data quality objectives process in building consensus and identifying multiple uses of results. The relatively limited adverse effects of this likely worst-case scenario for ash-related exposures in a lotic environment provide important context for the USEPA's new coal combustion residue disposal rules.

	abstract = {Hatchery supplementation has been widely used as a restoration technique for American Shad Alosa sapidissima on the East Coast of the USA, but results have been equivocal. In the Penobscot River, Maine, dam removals and other improvements to fish passage will likely reestablish access to the majority of this species' historic spawning habitat. Additional efforts being considered include the stocking of larval American Shad. The decision about whether to stock a river system undergoing restoration should be made after evaluating the probability of natural recolonization and examining the costs and benefits of potentially accelerating recovery using a stocking program. However, appropriate evaluation can be confounded by a dearth of information about the starting population size and age structure of the remnant American Shad spawning run in the river. We used the Penobscot River as a case study to assess the theoretical sensitivity of recovery time to either scenario (stocking or not) by building a deterministic model of an American Shad population. This model is based on the best available estimates of size at age, fecundity, rate of iteroparity, and recruitment. Density dependence was imposed, such that the population reached a plateau at an arbitrary recovery goal of 633,000 spawning adults. Stocking had a strong accelerating effect on the time to modeled recovery (as measured by the time to reach 50\% of the recovery goal) in the base model, but stocking had diminishing effects with larger population sizes. There is a diminishing return to stocking when the starting population is modestly increased. With a low starting population (a spawning run of 1,000), supplementation with 12 million larvae annually accelerated modeled recovery by 12years. Only a 2-year acceleration was observed if the starting population was 15,000. Such a heuristic model may aid managers in assessing the costs and benefits of stocking by incorporating a structured decision framework. Received December 27, 2011; accepted December 19, 2012},

Plant community composition was quantified in three zones (marsh-dune border, central marsh, and marsh-cultivated land border) identified across the gradient. The results suggest that the distribution and variation in abundance "performance" of plant species is mainly ruled by salinity and soil texture gradients (from sandy to silt-clay). Texture seemed to affect vegetation zonation in the marshes near sand dunes, since at the marsh-dune border the percentage of wind-blown sand increases. Variations in field capacity, total organic carbon, pH, and calcium carbonate did not appear to control the performance of plant species. Indications on the performance of six species are provided. Limbarda crithmoides increased with the amount of sand and was often located at the marsh-dune border. Elymus repens and Phragmites australis increased with decreasing salinity and were frequently found at marsh borders, however E. repens also increased with the amount of silt-clay. Sarcocornia fruticosa increased with salinity and silt-clay, while Halimione portulacoides increased with salinity and seemed less subject to changes in soil texture. Elymus pycnanthus increased with salinity and decreased with the amount of silt-clay, however, the ordination suggested that other factors may be determinant for this species. These species could be useful to map saline environments and to reconstruct an appropriate scenario in restoration projects of Mediterranean salt marshes.},

	abstract = {The Azores bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina) is an endemic bird of Sao Miguel island (Azores Archipelago, Portugal), currently threatened by two of the major causes of biodiversity loss worldwide: invasion of native habitats by exotic plants and habitat destruction by land use changes. The aim of this research was to develop and test a novel spatially explicit modelling framework that predicts the Azores bullfinch responses to alternative realistic scenarios of native forest management. This was done by integrating Multi-Model Inference statistical analysis, Stochastic-Dynamic Modelling and Geographic Information Systems under a common framework relating bird population trends to changes in the surrounding habitats. Overall, in the next 25 years, the Azores bullfinch breeding population was predicted to increase around 19\% as a consequence of habitat management actions already implemented ("LIFE Priolo" project) or around 27\% in the context of realistic future habitat restoration scenarios. These results represent, respectively, a supplementary increase of more 6\% or more 13\% in the Azores bullfinch abundance when compared with the trends simulated for the scenario without management. Nevertheless, those actions seemed to be relatively ineffective in promoting the expansion of the species from the actual restricted favourable area, essentially due to local forestry dynamics and on-going plant invasion processes. This novel integrative approach provides a promising baseline to support ecological models with increased realism and predictive power, making the outputs more useful and intuitive to decision-makers and environmental managers.

Using the Heureka system, scenarios of 0\%, 5\%, and 20\% retained patches at the stand level were projected over 200 years in a 533 ha boreal landscape. Visualizations of future forest states at a landscape scale and a more detailed scale were made based on the projections. The no retention results in no forest {\textgreater}120 years old, and no large trees (diameter at breast height {\textgreater}40 cm for conifers and {\textgreater}35 cm for broadleaved trees) 100 years from now. With retention levels of 5\% and 20\%, the area of old forest will comprise 7\% and 19\% of the total area, respectively. The average number of large trees per ha will be 4 and 13, respectively. Deadwood volumes will be 2.5 times higher at 5\% retention and 4 times higher at 20\% retention compared to no retention. Landscape visualizations indicate that retention patches covering 5\% will marginally modify the visual impression, compared to clear-cuts, while 20\% cover will create a much more varied landscape. We conclude that the retention approach is essential for restoring natural conditions. Landscape transformation will be slow and depend on starting conditions and retention levels.},

Application of the framework suggested that equivalent plantings in different configurations can have markedly different outcomes in terms of resultant stream temperature. There is no single best solution for all stream-restoration projects but, through the use of this framework, environmental planners, designers and managers can compare scenarios and make appropriate decisions for specific streams.},

	abstract = {Tissue engineering with adult stem cells is a promising approach for the restoration of focal defects in articular cartilage. For this, progenitor cells would ideally be delivered to (and maintained within) the defect site via a biocompatible material and in combination with soluble factors to promote initial cell differentiation and subsequent tissue maturation in vivo. While growth factor delivery methods are continually being optimized, most offer only a short (days to weeks) delivery profile at high doses. To address this issue, we investigated mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation and maturation in photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels with transient exposure to the pro-chondrogenic molecule transforming growth factor-beta3 (TGF-beta 3), at varying doses (10, 50 and 100 ng/mL) and durations (3, 7, 21 and 63 days). Mechanical, biochemical, and histological outcomes were evaluated through 9 weeks of culture. Results showed that a brief exposure (7 days) to a very high level (100 ng/mL) of TGF-beta 3 was sufficient to both induce and maintain cartilage formation in these 3D constructs. Indeed, this short delivery resulted in constructs with mechanical and biochemical properties that exceeded that of continuous exposure to a lower level (10 ng/mL) of TGF-beta 3 over the entire 9-week time course. Of important note, the total TGF delivery in these two scenarios was roughly equivalent (200 vs. 180 ng), but the timing of delivery differed markedly. These data support the idea that acute exposure to a high dose of TGF will induce functional and long-term differentiation of stem cell populations, and further our efforts to improve cartilage repair in vivo.

The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

In human health-care provision, a range of care options is generally available to cover the various levels of treatment required and the degree of urgency of that treatment. The concept of triage is frequently used in emergency situations where many people may be injured and decisions have to be made on the relative urgency of treatment for different individuals versus the relative likelihood of the success of that treatment. Indeed, the need to decide on level and type of care extends throughout health-care provision, and the array of health-care options available can be displayed on a grid that considers relative level of need or threat and the probability of recovery. A similar grid can be constructed for landscape management, which considers level of threat and the probability of system persistence or recovery. The grid differentiates between a variety of scenarios ranging from the need for prompt management action to protect or restore important habitat through to preventative threat minimization. We suggest that the broad concept of triage goes beyond the simple allocation of patients, landscapes or species into urgent, not urgent, and terminal categories and, instead, offers a rational basis for considering allocation of appropriate levels of management to different situations. We also suggest that the practice of restoration has much to learn from health care, where decisions are made daily on the allocation of appropriate levels of care.},

	abstract = {The logic, structure and preliminary results from a mathematical model of the Black and Azov Sea ecosystems are presented in response to the need for a theoretical framework to analyse recent drastic decreases in catches of anchovy. The modelling approach is dictated by incomplete data for many key processes involved in the disastrous ecosystem changes that have impacted fisheries in these inland seas since the late 1980s. These not only resulted in environmental changes and negative impacts on fisheries, but also in the introduction of the exotic planktonic predator, the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leydei; however, their relative importance is unclear from the limited data available. The objectives of this first project phase are to: reconstruct the introduction of M. leydei, study different hypotheses of its trophic interaction with anchovy, and consider alternatives for rehabilitation of the commercial stocks. The model is modular, with subsystems for the Black and Azov Seas and linked flows and migrations of energy, organic matter and fish biomass, specified, as a system of difference and algebraic equations, both at the system level and the level of energy balance of individual organisms. Emphasis is on documenting hypotheses for transformation of incoming energy by pelagic zooplankton and fish of the two seas to average densities per square metre of surface. The Black Sea trophic chain is more detailed, including 18 components (excluding age groups), but the Azov Sea model is limited to 11 components. The anchovy population is the only one with age structure specified (larvae, juveniles and three adult stages). The model does not represent detailed transformations of organics or the biogenic cycle, which, with primary production, are considered as model driving factors, and impacts of pelagic production on benthic/demersal ecosystems are only considered incidentally, via pelagic detrital outflows to sink. The model is aimed at a parsimonious description of the main processes and mechanisms of inter and intra-annual population dynamics, the impacts of environmental conditions, of spawning and seasonal migrations for anchovy, with or without specified impacts by jelly predators. Simulations considered three scenarios covering 1966-2000, divided into three phases. Model identification was based on 1996-1982 data, verification in 1983-1993, and the last phase (1994-2000) was used to validate model reliability. Three scenarios were considered: (i) absence of M. leydei, (ii) only food competition between anchovy and the ctenophore and (iii), in addition to (ii), predation of anchovy larvae by M. leydei. Results are presented as graphic and tabular outputs of annual and seasonal variations, energy balances, and values for other system variables. The model is available for operation under the Windows 95/NT environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using data on land-use change, biomass accumulation in secondary forests, and ratios between gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon emissions, we developed a model of the carbon budget for Puerto Rico between 1936 and 2060. As a consequence of land abandonment, forests have expanded rapidly since 1950, achieving the highest sequestration rates between 1980 and 1990. Regardless of future scenarios of demography and land use, sequestration rates will decrease in the future because biomass accumulation decreases with forest age and there is little agricultural land remaining to be abandoned. Due to high per-capita consumption and population density, carbon emissions of Puerto Rico have increased dramatically and exceeded carbon sequestration during the second half of the 20th century. Although Puerto Rico had the highest percent of reforestation for a tropical country, emissions during the period 1950-2000 were approximately 3.5 times higher than sequestration, and current annual emission is almost nine times the rate of sequestration. Additionally, while sequestration will decrease over the next six decades, current socioeconomic trends suggest increasing emissions unless there are significant changes in energy technology or consumption patterns. In conclusion, socioeconomic changes leading to urbanization and industrialization in tropical countries may promote high rates of carbon sequestration during the decades following land abandonment. Initial high rates of carbon sequestration can balance emissions of developing countries with low emission/GDP ratio. In Puerto Rico, the socioeconomic changes that promoted reforestation also promoted high-energy consumption, and resulted in a net increase in carbon emissions.},

Nineteen experts participated in the conjoint analysis. The sample comprised researchers and practitioners with local knowledge of grassy ecosystems. The survey involved repeated pairwise ranking of the relevance of attributes of seven ecological criteria. The relative weightings of the attributes were then used to generate the 50 top-ranked species for each of the three scenarios. Overall phosphorus tolerance was considered the most important criterion, followed by grazing tolerance. Species favoured for high-level conservation management included nutrient- and grazing-intolerant plants with narrower distributions and some species of threatened status. The two scenarios with histories of fertilization and varying levels of ongoing grazing were most similar in that their lists were dominated by graminoids and did not contain any shrubs or geophytes. The ranking of species provides an initial list that could be tailored to take into account specific site conditions and additional knowledge of species. This approach to the selection of species shows promise as either a repeatable process to select species for particular sites, or to generate a classification of species that could be used generically for a small number of common situations.},

	abstract = {The definition of a common vision that includes social and environmental goals, ecosystem services and/or biodiversity features that people are interested in maintaining or restoring is a great challenge for marine protected areas (MPAs). Recent initiatives have promoted broadening the focus from biodiversity conservation alone to the conservation of both ecosystem services and biodiversity, indicating that this integration should improve support and compliance from stakeholders. Using a Multiple-Use Coastal Marine Protected Area recently proposed in northern Chile, we investigated (i) stakeholders' perceptions of the valuation of ecosystem services, threats to their provision, and the prioritization of ecosystem services, biodiversity features, and uses in a planning scenario, and (ii) stakeholders' expectations for the establishment of a new MPA. The perceptions of different groups of stakeholders were compared and statistically analyzed, and the relationships among prioritizations were studied using a network approach. Stakeholders identified and valued 13 ecosystem services, 28 biodiversity features, 20 uses and activities, and 22 threats. Significant differences among the valuations and prioritizations of different stakeholder groups were attributable principally to artisanal fishermen's perceptions of some components that are directly related to their activities and livelihoods. High expectations of benefits from a new MPA implementation were observed for all categories of stakeholders. To relate the different valuated components, we proposed a network-based conceptual model that reduces complexity, and also as a strategy to communicate relationships and trade-offs occurring in this particular social-ecological system to the several stakeholders. We strongly recommend early stakeholder engagement so as to understand the variability in environmental perceptions and then reflect that variation in the planning and management actions of MPAs, thus improving support for their implementation and achieving conservation and societal goals. Our findings indicate that stakeholders' perceptions and prioritizadons of ecosystem services, biodiversity features and uses should be used as the basis for starting the MPA implementation and planning process.

Population viability analysis provides one tool for exploring the impact of management actions on large temporal scales. However, there are relatively few long-term data sets that provide the demographic and environmental data demanded by such models. Using a 37-yr data set, we used RAMAS Metapop to model the persistence of natterjack toads Epidalea (Bufo) calamita on a heathland in southern Britain. A retrospective analysis showed that the best fit between the predicted population trajectories and the real population was when the management carried out was modelled as an increase in K of 150 toads yr-1. However, even if ongoing management continues to improve K by a further 40-60 toads yr-1 over the next 50 yr, the population still has an extinction risk of at least 60\% if other factors remain unchanged. Sensitivity analyses and simulated management scenarios indicated that the population was most sensitive to changes in the survival of juvenile (i.e. 1-2 yr old) toads. In addition, if the frequency and severity of pond desiccation increases, the risk of extinction was predicted to increase as a result of reduced recruitment. Low levels of extinction risk occurred irrespective of K when juvenile survival was enhanced in combination with low frequency and severity of pond desiccation. The models suggest that populations that are responding to management against a background of natural fluctuations may remain vulnerable to extinction for several decades. These extinction risks may increase if habitat management fails to offset reductions in recruitment and juvenile survival caused by environmental change.},

The effects on soils irrigated with saline water are investigated. Actual investigations were carried out in land irrigated with salinity-affected wastewater and non-irrigated land nearby. Soil profile analyses are demonstrated and compared, showing very interesting results and adverse effects on soil resources. Irrigation with saline waters even at slightly above recommended values can have severe effects on soil resources.

	abstract = {A long-standing debate within conservation is how best to allocate limited management resources: should reserve area be increased, should anthropogenic disturbances be mitigated, or should connectivity be increased? We explore these issues for the San Diego cactus wren, a California Species of Special Concern. To assess the relative benefit of different post-fire habitat restoration strategies, we forecasted wren abundance over the next 100 years under three restoration strategies: (i) create new “stepping stone” habitat patches to form corridors which connect existing patches, (ii) augment existing habitat patches, and (iii) create new habitat patches in areas with low fire risk. We considered both small-scale and large-scale restoration efforts of 20 and 200 ha of habitat, respectively. To forecast wren abundance, we used a meta-population model created from maps of wren abundance, cactus abundance, land use, and estimated fire probability. Estimates of fire probability were obtained by relating previous fire locations to environmental variables and human population density. Results indicate that the best management strategy for a 20-ha restoration effort is to augment habitat in patches habitable for wrens, and that the best strategy for 180 ha of additional restoration (or 200 total hectares) is to improve wren dispersal via new corridors. Results also indicate that there is no decline in long-term wren abundance caused by planning the first 20 ha of restoration separately from planning a subsequent 180 ha. Our modeling approach provides insight into the relative benefit of several realistic restoration scenarios, providing an important tool for species conservation and habitat restoration on complex landscapes.},

Connectivity between the remaining populations in the habitat fragments is essential for their long-term persistence and focus of management initiatives. We describe an individual-based, spatially explicit model of tiger movement behavior based on previously developed habitat models to (i) quantify inter-patch connectivity among major (protected) habitat patches in the Terai Arc Landscape of India and Nepal and (ii) investigate the effect of potential management initiatives, e.g. restoring corridors, on enhancing connectivity among fragmented protected habitats. Connectivity was not solely a function of distance between patches, but an outcome of the interplay between movement behavior and landscape composition, with asymmetric connectivity explained by canalizing or diffusing effects of the landscape, and depending on the landscape context of the starting patch. Patch connectivity was mostly determined by autocorrelation in tiger movement, the daily movement capacity, landscape structure, and the amount of matrix habitat. Several habitat patches were likely to be island-like and already effectively isolated. However, simulating scenarios of corridor restoration showed that most habitat patches in India and between India and Nepal could recover connectivity, which may mitigate negative genetic consequences of small population size and effective isolation on tiger populations in this landscape. Combining habitat models with individual-based models is a powerful and robust approach that could be widely applied to delineate dispersal corridors of large carnivores and quantify patch connectivity even if data are scarce.},

Using projections of climate scenarios for the year 2060, we evaluated how several possible futures could affect wildlife populations (wading birds, fish, alligators, native apple snails, amphibians, threatened and invasive species) across the Everglades landscape and inform planning already underway. We used data collected from prior research and monitoring to parameterize our wildlife population models. Hydrologic data were simulated using a spatially explicit, regional-scale model. Our scenario evaluations show that expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level could significantly alter important ecological functions. All of our wildlife indicators were negatively affected by scenarios with less rainfall and more evapotranspiration. Under such scenarios, habitat suitability was substantially reduced for iconic animals such as wading birds and alligators. Conversely, the increased rainfall scenario benefited aquatic prey productivity and apex predators. Cascading impacts on non-native species is speculative, but increasing temperatures could increase the time between cold events that currently limit expansion and abundance of non-native fishes, amphibians, and reptiles with natural ranges in the tropics. This scenario planning framework underscored the benefits of proceeding with Everglades restoration plans that capture and clean more freshwater with the potential to mitigate rainfall loss and postpone impacts of sea level rise.},

We present a practical example of a low input approach for a small upland catchment.

Currently, many habitats in the catchment are in poor ecological condition limiting the provision of some ecosystem services. The two scenarios were ‘improve’ (investments are made to deliver a balance of ecosystem services through habitat restoration and less intensive land management) and ‘decline’ (future ecological decline due to a general withdrawal of public investment in land management and applying only the minimum environmental regulations). The ecosystem service (dis-)benefits of each scenario were quantified and valued using two different value transfer approaches. The ecosystem services assessed were carbon storage, biodiversity (or wildlife value) and water quality. Both valuation approaches showed positive benefit-cost ratios for the ‘improve’ scenario and negative ratios for the ‘decline’ scenario. Even with this limited suite of ecosystem services the analysis provides a convincing case for investment in the catchment. The sensitivity of the analysis to assumptions made through the valuation is explored and improvements suggested.},

	abstract = {The reintroduction of large mammals is often considered a priority conservation action in highly industrialized countries in which many of these species have been depleted. However, species reintroduction after decades of absence may involve important risks for human activities and ecological communities, such as favoring the spread of diseases. An example of a potentially troublesome reintroduction is the wild boar, which may act as a reservoir of diseases, e. g., classical swine fever, and cause high economic losses, and has become a species of concern in several European countries for both ecological and recreational reasons. Failure to prevent the disease consequences of species restoration can negate its conservation benefits. Here we evaluated the probability of both successfully reintroducing wild boar into Denmark and limiting their contact with domestic pig farms to which they might spread disease. For this purpose, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based population model that incorporates information on boar habitat and demography information from Central European populations. We then compared model predictions with the spatial distribution of farms to achieve a spatial assessment of the contact risk. The most restrictive model scenario predicted that nearly 6\% of Denmark provides habitat conditions that would allow wild boar to reproduce. The best habitats for reintroduction were aggregated in seven different areas throughout the country in which the extinction probability was {\textless} 5\%. However, the expected population expansion was very limited in most of these areas. Both the number of suitable areas and the potential for population expansion greatly increased when we relaxed our habitat assumptions about boar forest requirements; this provided a more conservative scenario for a cautious risk analysis. We additionally found that part of the risk of contact with piggeries was associated with the magnitude of the expansion, although the nonrandom spatial pattern of farm distribution also had a strong influence. The partitioning of risks into those related to population expansion and those related to farm distribution allowed us to identify trade-offs between restoring boar populations and minimizing risks in different potential areas and under different risk scenarios; as a result, we rejected some of the particularly high-risk areas for potential reintroduction of the species. Our approach illustrates how the joint quantification of anticipated reintroduction success and associated risks can guide efforts aimed at reconciling species recovery and the affected health and economic interests.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an integrative method for quantifying, analyzing, and comparing the effects of alternative rehabilitation approaches with visual preference. The method was applied to a portion of a major industrial area located in southern Italy. Four alternative approaches to rehabilitation (alternative designs) were developed and analyzed. The scenarios consisted of the cleanup of the brownfields plus: (1) the addition of ground cover species; (2) the addition of ground cover species and a few trees randomly distributed; (3) the addition of ground cover species and a few trees in small groups; and (4) the addition of ground cover species and several trees in large groups. The approaches were analyzed and compared to the baseline condition through the use of cost-surface modeling (CSM) and visual preference assessment (VPA). Statistical results showed that alternatives that were more ecologically functional for forest bird species dispersal were also more visually preferable. Some differences were identified based on user groups and location of residence. The results of the study are used to identify implications for enhancing both ecological attributes and visual preferences of rehabilitating landscapes through planning and design.},

A fast method was applied to evaluate five focal services, including water conservation, gas regulation, climate regulation, waste treatment, and erosion control. The results found that, with the assumption of vegetation fraction increasing from 15\% to 40\%, the net benefit would reach from 3.01 billion CNY to 5.09 billion CNY, and current restoration measures could recover grassland to its former level in 1950s.

	abstract = {The coastal zone of The Gambia consists of 70 km open ocean coast and 200 km sheltered coast. Only about 20 km of the open coastline is significantly developed and this includes Banjul (the capital city), Bakau and Cape St. Mary, Fajara and the Tourism Development Area (TDA). Tourism is the most important economic sector in the coastal zone and contributes about 10\% of the government revenue. Fisheries and agriculture are also important coastal industries. In this study the Aerial Videotape-assisted Vulnerability Analysis (AVVA) technique has been used to provide a detailed analysis of vulnerability to sea level rise, and adaptation strategies have been identified. The data used includes a video recording of the coastline, color infrared and black and white aerial photography, topographic maps, bathymetric maps, a geological map of The Gambia and still photographs. The data have been used to characterize the coastal zone into 9 geomorphological units, wherein the cultural and heritage sites of economic importance have been delineated and characterized according to their biophysical and economic importance. Future erosion rates have been projected by applying the Bruun Rule, and future total land loss due to inundation in response to global warming and accelerated sea level rise has been determined. The sea level rise scenarios considered are 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m per century. Inundation is estimated to be about 92.32 x 10(6) m(2) for a 1.0 m sea level rise, 45.89 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.5 m sea level rise and 4.96 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.2 m sea level rise. The greater part of this area lost will be wetlands and mangrove systems important for fish spawning areas and habitats for wildlife. Shoreline retreat is estimated to vary between about 6.8 m in cliffy areas to about 880 m for more flat and sandy areas based on the Bruun Rule. Population and physical structures at risk have been determined. Attempts have been made to report this loss in monetary terms, but firm figures are not yet available. Only one unit of the coastal zone has been evaluated. In this unit, it is expected that the capital city will be completely lost through both erosion and inundation within 50 to 60 yr with a total of 42000 persons displaced. Lands and physical structures to be lost are estimated at US\$ 217 million. Response strategies and adaptation options identified include: innovative sand management, building and rehabilitation of groins, construction of revetments to protect important areas, construction of sea-walls/bulkheads, public outreach and awareness, building regulations and urban growth planning, wetland preservation and mitigation, and development of a coastal zone management plan.},

	abstract = {Evaluating management options for mitigating the impacts of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) is a major goal for road ecology. Fencing along roads in conjunction with the construction of wildlife road passages has been widely accepted as the most effective way to minimize WVC. However, limited resources often require wildlife managers to focus on a single method of mitigation, yet the relative effectiveness of fences and passages for reducing road mortality and restoring population connectivity is unclear. Using the stone marten (Manes foina, Erxleben, 1777) as a model species, we developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to develop predictions concerning the relative performance of fencing and passage construction under different rates of road mortality. For five levels each, we varied probability of road mortality, fencing extent, and number of passages in a full factorial design, for a total of 125 management scenarios. We then compared the relative impact of these two mitigation approaches on population abundance (N) and genetic differentiation (F-st) using linear regression. Our results predict that fences are much more effective than passages at mitigating the effects of road mortality on abundance. Moreover, we show that under most circumstances, fences are also more effective than passages at reducing genetic differentiation. This is likely driven by the ability of fencing to eliminate road mortality, which in turn increases genetic diversity, thereby slowing differentiation across the road. However, partial fencing can reduce road mortality nearly as well as full fencing. Moreover, partial fencing also allows adequate population connectivity across roads. Thus, we argue that partial fencing of roads alone may often be the best and most cost-effective management option for road mitigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is a continued need to understand how human activities along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast are impacting the natural ecosystems. The gulf coast is experiencing rapid population growth and associated land cover/land use change. Mobile Bay, AL is a designated pilot region of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) and is the focus area of many current NASA and NOAA studies, for example. This is a critical region, both ecologically and economically to the entire United States because it has the fourth largest freshwater inflow in the continental USA, is a vital nursery habitat for commercially and recreational important fisheries, and houses a working waterfront and port that is expanding. Watershed and hydrodynamic modeling has been performed for Mobile Bay to evaluate the impact of land use change in Mobile and Baldwin counties on the aquatic ecosystem. Watershed modeling using the Loading Simulation Package in C++ (LSPC) was performed for all watersheds contiguous to Mobile Bay for land use Scenarios in 1948, 1992, 2001, and 2030. The Prescott Spatial Growth Model was used to project the 2030 land use scenario based on observed trends. All land use scenarios were developed to a common land classification system developed by merging the 1992 and 2001 National Land Cover Data (NLCD). The LSPC model output provides changes in flow, temperature, sediments and general water quality for 22 discharge points into the Bay. These results were inputted in the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Computer Code (EFDC) hydrodynamic model to generate data on changes in temperature, salinity, and sediment concentrations on a grid with four vertical profiles throughout the Bay's aquatic ecosystems. The models were calibrated using in-situ data collected at sampling stations in and around Mobile bay. This phase of the project has focused on sediment modeling because of its significant influence on light attenuation which is a critical factor in the health of submerged aquatic vegetation. The impact of land use change on sediment concentrations was evaluated by analyzing the LSPC and EFDC sediment simulations for the four land use scenarios. Such analysis was also performed for storm and non-storm periods. In- situ data of total suspended sediments (TSS) and light attenuation were used to develop a regression model to estimate light attenuation from TSS. This regression model was used to derive marine light attenuation estimates throughout Mobile bay using the EFDC TSS outputs. The changes in sediment concentrations and associated impact on light attenuation in the aquatic ecosystem were used to perform an ecological analysis to evaluate the impact on seagreasses and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) habitat. This is the key product benefiting the Mobile Bay coastal environmental managers that integrates the influences of sediments due to land use driven flow changes with the restoration potential of SAVs. This project is a collaborative effort between NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Universities Space Research Association, NASA Stennis Space Center, Battelle at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Tetra Tech Engineering, and Prescott College.},

	abstract = {Land-use land-cover change is one of the most important and direct drivers of changes in ecosystem functions and services. Given the complexity of the decision-making, there is a need for Internet-based decision support systems with scenario evaluation capabilities to help planners, resource managers and communities visualize, compare and consider trade-offs among the many values at stake in land use planning. This article presents details on an Ecosystem Portfolio Model (EPM) prototype that integrates ecological, socio-economic information and associated values of relevance to decision-makers and stakeholders. The EPM uses a multi-criteria scenario evaluation framework, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis and spatially-explicit land-use/land-cover change-sensitive models to characterize changes in important land-cover related ecosystem values related to ecosystem services and functions, land parcel prices, and community quality-of-life (QoL) metrics. Parameters in the underlying models can be modified through the interface, allowing users in a facilitated group setting to explore simultaneously issues of scientific uncertainty and divergence in the preferences of stakeholders. One application of the South Florida EPM prototype reported in this article shows the modeled changes (which are significant) in aggregate ecological value, landscape patterns and fragmentation, biodiversity potential and ecological restoration potential for current land uses compared to the 2050 land-use scenario. Ongoing refinements to EPM, and future work especially in regard to modifiable sea level rise scenarios are also discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {For many decades, pike populations in Belgium have been suffering from a decline of the environmental quality due to habitat deterioration, water pollution and many other degrading phenomena. Since past attempts to rehabilitate the pike populations had only limited success, it is of importance to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of pike such that more effective restoration programs can be effectuated in the future. Ideally, this can be accomplished by relying on telemetry data, but since the collection of such data is both labour-intensive and costly, researchers often resort to a simulation-based approach, which on its turn requires a sound spatio-temporal model. Therefore, and as a first step towards an integrated individual-based model (IBM) for describing pike dynamics in rivers, an IBM mimicking the movement of pike in the river Yser, Belgium, is proposed in this paper. This model considers the specificities of pike, such as its seasonally dependent migration, swimming speed and habitat preference, and is based upon environmental data from the river Yser. It is shown that the in silico spatio-temporal dynamics coincides with the one that is typically inferred from in situ observations. Amongst other things, the proposed model may be relied upon to identify the most appropriate management and restoration measures through a scenario analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Restoration of the Bay has been the focus of a two-decade regional partnership of local, state and federal agencies, including a network of scientists, politicians and activists interacting through various committees, working groups, and advisory panels. The effectiveness of the restoration effort has been mixed, with both notable successes and failures. The overall health of the Bay has not declined since the restoration was initiated in 1983, but many of the advances have been offset by the pressure of increasing population and exurban sprawl across the watershed. The needs of the Chesapeake Bay Program are many, but the greatest is accurate information on land cover and land use change, primarily to assess the implications for water quality, examine various restoration scenarios, and calibrate spatial models of the urbanization process. We report here on a number of new land cover and land use data products, and associated applications to assist vulnerability assessment, integrated ecosystem analysis, and ultimately Bay restoration. We provide brief overviews of applications to model new residential development, assess losses and vulnerability of resource lands, and identify the factors that disrupt the health of streams in small watersheds. These data products and approaches are being applied by a number of agencies involved with the restoration effort, including the Chesapeake Bay Program's activities focused on living resources, water quality, and sound land use.},

Due to its increasing prevalence in arid regions throughout the western US, we predicted that an exotic species, Tamarix, would have the greatest increase in suitable habitat relative to native counterparts under CC. We used an ecological niche model to predict range shifts of Populus fremontii, Salix gooddingii, Salix exigua and Tamarix, from present day to 2080s, under five general circulation models and one climate change scenario (A1B). Four major findings emerged. 1) Contrary to our original hypothesis, P. fremontii is projected to have the greatest increase in suitable habitat under CC, followed closely by Tamarix. 2) Of the native species, S. gooddingii and S. exigua showed the greatest loss in predicted suitable habitat due to CC. 3) Nearly 80 percent of future P. fremontii and Salix habitat is predicted to be affected by either CC or Tamarix by the 2080s. 4) By the 2080s, 20 percent of S. gooddingii habitat is projected to be affected by both Tamarix and CC concurrently, followed by S. exigua (19 percent) and P. fremontii (13 percent). In summary, while climate change alone will negatively impact both native willow species, Tamarix is likely to affect a larger portion of all three native species' distributions. We discuss these and other results in the context of prioritizing restoration and conservation efforts to optimize future productivity and biodiversity. As we are accounting for only direct effects of CC and Tamarix on native habitat, we present a possible hierarchy of effects- from the direct to the indirect- and discuss the potential for the indirect to outweigh the direct effects. Our results highlight the need to account for simultaneous challenges in the face of CC.},

	abstract = {Over the last century there has been marked expansion and infilling of pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper Juniperus spp.) woodlands into grassland and shrubland ecosystems across the western United States. Although range expansions in pinyon-juniper populations have been documented with changing climate throughout the Holocene, over the last century, local scale impacts such as livestock grazing, changes in fire regimes, and increasing atmospheric CO(2) concentrations are thought to be more recent drivers of pinyon-juniper woodland distribution. Our objective was to examine the role of historical livestock grazing relative to past climate in regulating pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.) recruitment and growth over the last Century in a persistent pinyon-juniper woodland. We compared pinyon dynamics oil a remote mesa site, minimally grazed by domestic livestock, to a nearby historically grazed site in southeastern Utah. The presence of a significant number of old trees ({\textgreater} 200 yr) at both sites suggests that these populations were well established prior to the 20th century. No differences in pinyon density or basal area were observed between grazed and ungrazed sites. Stand age structure data showed that pinyon recruitment across these sites was highly synchronous, with a large recruitment event occurring during the early 1900s; 17\% of the pinyons oil both sites dated to the 1920s. Climatic conditions during this decade were consistently cool and wet-conditions known to Support enhanced recruitment and growth in pinyon pines. Pinyon growth was also strongly synchronous across sites (r = 0.96). Pinyon growth was significantly correlated with winter/spring precipitation and negatively correlated with June temperature. Taken together, our results Suggest that past climate may be more important in structuring pinyon populations than historical land use in these persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. Given future climate projections of increasing temperature and more extended drought periods, regeneration of pinyon populations following the recent regional-scale dieback may be slow. Moreover, prolonged drought combined with potentially slow regeneration times for pinyon under future climate scenarios Could result in substantial declines in pinyon populations across the region, a result that land managers should consider when planning for future restoration treatments in persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands.},

	abstract = {Managing human-dominated landscapes such as agroecosystems is one of the main challenges facing society today. Decisions about land-use management in agroecosystems involve spatial and temporal trade-offs. The key scales at which these trades-offs occur are poorly understood for most systems, and quantitative assessments of the services provided by agroecosystems under different combinations of land uses are rare. To fill these knowledge gaps, we measured 12 ecosystem services (ES), including climate regulation, gas regulation, soil stability, nutrient regulation, habitat quality, raw material production, food production, fishing, sports, recreation, education, and social relationships, in seven common land-use types at three spatial scales, i.e., patch, municipality, and landscape, in a riparian floodplain in Spain. We identified the provision of each ES in each land-use type either by direct measurement or from public databases. We analyzed the interactions, i.e., trade-offs and synergies, among ES across land uses and spatial scales and estimated ES provision in several land-use change scenarios. Our results illustrated that each land-use type provides unique bundles of ES and that the spatial scale at which measurements were taken affected the mixture of services. For instance, a land-use type with low provision of services per hectare but with an extensive area can supply more services to the overall landscape than a land-use type supplying higher values of services per hectare but with a smaller extent. Hence, riparian forest supplied the most service of any land-use type at the patch scale, but dry cereal croplands provided the most services across the municipality and landscape because of their large area. We found that most ES should be managed primarily at the patch scale, but food production, fishing, and social relationships were more relevant to manage at the municipality scale. There was great variability in ES interactions across scales with different causes of trade-offs at each scale. We identified more significant synergies among ES than trade-offs. Trade-offs were originated because some services were mutually incompatible within a given land use, whereas the provision of others depended on land-management decisions within a land-use type. Thus, we propose a classification of ES interactions that incorporates societal values as drivers of management decisions along with biophysical factors as likely causes of ES trade-offs and conclude with practical suggestions to reduce trade-offs and to enhance the supply of multiple ES to society.},

	abstract = {Aim To identify priority areas for amphibian conservation in southeastern Brazil, by integrating species life-history traits and patterns of deforestation. Location State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods We used the software Marxan to evaluate different scenarios of amphibian conservation planning. Our approach differs from previous methods by explicitly including two different landscape metrics; habitat split for species with aquatic larvae, and habitat loss for species with terrestrial development. We evaluated the effect of habitat requirements by classifying species breeding habitats in five categories (flowing water, still water permanent, still water temporary, bromeliad or bamboo, and terrestrial). We performed analyses using two scales, grid cells and watersheds and also considered nature preserves as protected areas. Results We found contrasting patterns of deforestation between coastal and inland regions. Seventy-six grid cells and 14 watersheds are capable of representing each species at least once. When accounting for grid cells already protected in state and national parks and considering species habitat requirements we found 16 high-priority grid cells for species with one or two reproductive habitats, and only one cell representing species with four habitat requirements. Key areas for the conservation of species breeding in flowing and permanent still waters are concentrated in southern state, while those for amphibians breeding in temporary ponds are concentrated in central to eastern zones. Eastern highland zones are key areas for preserving species breeding terrestrially by direct or indirect development. Species breeding in bromeliads and bamboos are already well represented in protected areas. Main conclusions Our results emphasize the need to integrate information on landscape configuration and species life-history traits to produce more ecologically relevant conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {The European regulatory system for the approval of pesticides includes a thorough evaluation of risks to the environment and is designed to be protective of ecosystems. However, a decision to ban an agrochemical could also potentially have a negative impact on the value of ecosystem services, if resulting changes in crop management are damaging to ecosystems or result in negative socio-economic impacts. To support regulatory decision-making, consideration of ecosystem services to identify best environmental management options could be a way forward. There is generally a growing trend for the consideration of ecosystem services in decision making. Ecosystems provide the conditions for growing food, regulate water and provide wildlife habitats; these, amongst others, are known as ecosystem services. The objectives of this case study were to bring a holistic approach to decision making by valuing the environmental, social and economic benefits derived from the use of chlorpyrifos in Valencian citrus production. Spanish growers harvest between 5 and 6 million t of citrus annually, worth an estimated (sic)5 to 7 billion in food markets throughout Europe. The approach highlighted the potential for unintended negative consequences of regulatory decisions if the full context is not considered. In this study, rather than a regulatory restriction, the best option was the continued use of chlorpyrifos together with vegetated conservation patches as refuges for non-target insects. The conservation patches offset potential insecticidal impacts to insects whilst maintaining citrus production, farm income and the amenity value of the citrus landscape of Valencia. This was an initial proof-of-concept study and illustrates the importance of a wider perspective; other cases may have different outcomes depending on policies, the pesticide, crop scenarios, farm economics and the region.

	abstract = {Community persistence, or the ability of a community to maintain species composition and diversity through time, is a component of stability that is important to restoration. We ran a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment for three years, and then stopped weeding it for 5-6 years, which allowed us to test whether increased plant species diversity and dissimilarity in height would lead to increased community persistence in the face of high invasion pressure by non-native species. Our approach was unique in that the experiment varied richness (one or four species) and evenness (three levels plus monocultures of the dominant species) using two separate dissimilarity types (having all tall species or having tall and short species combined) in six spatiotemporal blocks. Persistence was quantified as to how well positive productivity-diversity relationships, proportion of planted native species, and species richness remained unchanged over time. Thus, high persistence values indicate low levels of invasion and local extinction. We found that the positive relationship between diversity measures and productivity persisted after cessation of weeding. The proportion of planted species was 32\% higher in mixture than in monoculture plots, indicating that monocultures were more heavily invaded by non-native species. Reduced evenness did not affect persistence measures in plots with dissimilar heights, but measures declined linearly with decreased evenness in plots with all tall species. Our results suggest that (1) persistence-diversity relationships are likely to vary with the traits of species becoming rare and going extinct, and (2) it is important to restore higher species diversity in restoration projects to favor the long-term persistence of planted species.},

	abstract = {In recent years, coastal mangroves have been frequently affected by large disturbances (cyclones, hurricanes, flooding and tsunamis) and post-disturbance vegetation is often dominated by small stature mangrove, mangrove-associate and non-mangrove species potentially affecting ecosystem functioning. Knowledge on the processes of mangrove vegetation development and recovery (succession) following normal and large disturbances will benefit practitioners in designing robust ecosystem management/restoration plans. Here we propose a conceptual model of disturbance-mediated succession in mangroves.
Based on field observations and species' life history traits, we develop conceptual models of mangrove succession under normal disturbance regime and recently experienced increased frequency of large disturbances. We evaluate our conceptual models by conducting a scenario testing experiment.
We suggest two predominant processes affecting mangrove succession after disturbance: propagule limitation due to damage of seed producing mature trees and dispersal barrier resulting from biological invasion associated with large disturbance. We argue that large disturbances affect mature trees more than the small-stature non-tree (shrubs, herbs and climbers) species creating a larger propagule shortage for mangrove tree species than non-tree species. Secondly, large disturbances facilitate invasion of free-floating aquatics, which may interfere with the flow-facilitated propagule dispersal and seedling establishment of mangrove species. In a scenario testing experiment, we have shown that similar levels of disturbance impact vegetation development and recovery differently depending on the presence or absence of invasive species. We conclude that since biological invasion is one of the major drivers of post-disturbance mangrove succession, the dimension of biological invasion should be included in prediction, management and restoration of mangrove forests.},

	abstract = {River-floodplain systems, and riparian forests in particular, offer physical contributions to human society such as flood mitigation and the maintenance of water quality, social benefits including the opportunity for recreation and solitude, as well as numerous ecological services. However, midwestern USA river landscapes have undergone much land-use change over time, such as widespread logging, the net loss of grasslands and wetlands, urbanization pressure, and increases in anthropogenic sedimentation. With its focus on spatial and temporal changes, landscape ecology is ideally suited to assess and quantify these riverlands modifications and it is currently used at the national, state, and sub-state level in efforts to restore or manage river and riparian landscapes, This two-part study explores the use of landscape ecology in smaller scale river conservation. First, we interviewed five locally-based, Midwestern non-profit conservation groups that were accomplishing significant river conservation and management work without intricate ecological plans. We found a tacit knowledge of fundamental landscape ecology concepts, and active interpretation to fit particular environmental situations. The groups were receptive to increased assistance from academic ecology, but the content must be clear, succinct, and easily integrated into frontline initiatives. To accomplish this goal, effort is needed from ecologists to construct new methods of delivering such information in an accessible and cost-effective manner. Second, we briefly explore land-use scenarios - based on realistic forest management agendas along the Wisconsin River (USA) - as one possible means of using applied science to assist local conservation efforts in prioritization of land parcels. Various land management scenarios to reinstate floodplain forest often produced similar improvements in metrics of landscape connectivity but differed markedly in the number of landowners affected.

On the basis of these considerations, the objective of the present paper is to draw up a preliminary inventory and present a brief characterisation of MTLs in Sicily, in line with the multidisciplinary experiences and approaches implemented at European and national levels. In defining the typological units, the terminology used to identify Sicilian MTLs was modified by experiences developed on the mainland, with entries such as: bocage/semi-bocage, coltura promiscua, Mediterranean open field, mountain landscape, huerta and terrace landscape. Using different spatialised data layers, including those concerned with the main historical processes of land use and land use change, a total of eight MTLs have been detected, mapped, and concisely described. The distribution and importance of terracing systems within the different MTLs is highlighted as one of the most relevant traditional elements in the rural scenario.},

By combining habitat and demographic modeling, landscape-based population viability models effectively relate small-scale habitat and landscape patterns to regional population viability. We demonstrate the power of landscape-based population viability models to inform conservation planning by using these models to evaluate responses of prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region to simulated conservation scenarios. We assessed the relative effectiveness of habitat restoration, afforestation, and increased survival and differed placement and levels of effort for implementing those approaches. Population projections of the two species confirmed the potential for large-scale conservation to sustain regional populations. For example, abundances of prairie warblers and wood thrush tripled under afforestation and increased survival scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, responses to conservation actions were driven by interacting local and large-scale population processes such as source-sink interactions and dispersal. Relying on randomly placed habitat conservation was ineffective and potentially counterproductive whereas strategic placements resulted in greater populations and viability of prairie warbler and wood thrush. These models offer a valuable advance in conservation planning because they allow an understanding of the effects of local actions on regional growth, which is necessary for translating regional goals into local actions.

	abstract = {Enhancing adaptation of forest ecosystems to prospective climate change is a major challenge in current forest management. Beyond potential negative effects of climate change such as decreasing productivity due to an increasing number of drought periods and damages from intensified disturbance regimes, there is also a potential for increasing productivity due to prolonged vegetation periods and higher photosynthetic rates. Quantitative genetic variation is crucial for adaptability of species towards environmental changes. The use of suitable reproductive material for forest regeneration will be a key factor essential for both, mitigating negative effects and making the most of potential positive effects. Therefore, insights into intraspecific variation within and among tree populations in climate response are of paramount importance.
In our study we investigated intraspecific variation in climate response among Norway spruce (Picea abies) populations in the eastern Alpine range. Results from a comprehensive Austrian provenance test, comprising tree heights at age 15 from 379 populations planted at 29 test sites across Austria. were used to calibrate climate response functions for groups of Norway spruce populations. Potential future changes in productivity for climate change conditions as represented by a regionalized A1B scenario were estimated using height at age 15 as a productivity proxy. Climate response functions were calculated for single populations and aggregated clusters of populations from climatically similar origins.
Our results hardly revealed any declines in employed proxies for productivity of Norway spruce throughout its current distribution range in Austria. For most parts of Austria an increase of tree heights up to 45 percent can be expected until 2080. However, the impact of a warming climate is different for individual population groups. Generally, variation in climate response increases with higher temperatures and less precipitation. Thus, an optimized choice of seed material according to prospective future climate conditions has the potential for an additional increase of productivity up to 11 percent.
In general, populations from currently warm and drought prone areas seem to be well adapted to respective climate conditions and may be appropriate candidates for extended utilization in future. Furthermore, populations showing the best productivity indices originate from regions, which are phylogenetically distinct from the core distribution area of Norway spruce, suggesting that population history might explain part of the variation in climate response among populations.

Coupled effects of soil density changes in soil hydraulic properties [i.e., soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and hydraulic conductivity] and root characteristics (root depth, vertical root distribution) found in past experimental studies may affect soil water suction, which are not fully understood. The objective of this study is to numerically investigate these coupled effects of soil density by systematically comparing suction profiles under three different scenarios: (1) changes in only soil hydraulic properties, (2) changes in only root characteristics, and (3) changes in both soil properties and root characteristics. Silty sand with two different degrees of compaction (DoC) (i.e., 82\% and 89\%), which are typically found on man-made slopes in subtropical regions, is considered. Schefflera heptaphylla is selected as vegetation species, which is commonly used for ecological restoration for man-made slopes. A laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify suction distribution in silty sand vegetated with Schefflera heptaphylla at DoC of 89\%. Vertical root distribution was measured using image analysis, while an axi-symmetric finite element analysis was conducted to calibrate transpiration rate from measured suction. Root characteristics corresponding to DoC of 82\% were then deduced using observations from literature. Richards equation coupled with sink term was numerically solved using Vadose/W to simulate water flow and root uptake on a flat ground (5 m depth, 10 m wide). Soil hydraulic parameters from a completely decomposed granite soil for two different DoCs (82\% and 89\%) were considered. Simulations assume constant transpiration rate for a period of 10 d. With increase in soil density from DoC of 82\% to 89\%, computed suction increases by 110\% for scenario 1 (only effect on soil hydraulic properties), whereas it decreases by at least 21\% for scenarios 2 (only root characteristics) and 3 (coupled effect). Here, a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and a lower actual transpiration rate balance effects of a lower desorption rate of SWCC.},

However, relatively little attention has been paid to the threat posed to biodiversity by invasive plants in a rapidly changing climate.

The spatial distribution of habitat suitability is modelled at the landscape scale for multiple exotic plant species under current climate and a climate change scenario for the year 2030. Expert opinion of the dominant dispersal mechanisms and weed status is used to model relative dispersal threat of each exotic plant species. These pattern and process outputs are integrated to create a multi-species management priority layer in an effort to synthesise the inherently complex outputs from multiple models of multiple species. The overall multispecies management index thus combines pattern and process to identify geographic locations at greatest threat from invasion under climate change.

We investigated changes in the condition of 212 river red gum trees (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), a long-lived flood dependent species, at 17 sites, over 18 years (1993-2011). Four variables were measured for each tree: crown density, crown size, dead branches and epicormic growth. More than half (56.13\%, 119) of the healthy trees first measured in 1993, showed no signs of life by 2011. Using historic inundation mapping, we identified that condition declined with reduced flooding. The probability of inundation in the previous five years had the strongest explanatory power, with strong increasing threshold responses of persistence and recovery associated with probabilities of flooding exceeding 5 years in the previous 10 years. We extended our modelling to the river red gum forests of the Macquarie Marshes floodplain, showing that 37\% of the area had a predicted survival probability lower than P = 0.6 while similar probabilities were present in only 12\% of the area within the Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve. The condition of river red gum forests, using the relationships identified, provide a useful measure of ecosystem health, particularly if extended to understanding of reproduction, germination and recruitment in relation to different scenarios for environmental flows. Embedding such a monitoring strategy in an adaptive management framework provides considerable promise for ongoing learning and improvement of management, not just for river red gums but also other indicators. There is a possibility that the current poor ecological condition of the Macquarie Marshes can be redressed with increased environmental flows restoring some of the river red gum forests that are a key characteristic of the wetland.

	abstract = {Modern societies have increasing demands for contaminant remediation and a continued supply of potable water. This is particularly the case in the densely populated and industrialized parts of North America and Europe. Coping with the demand, however, requires optimal geologic mapping and modeling methods, and for hydrogeologists to generate improved model scenarios using the best available geological information. Unfortunately, there is often a lack of collaboration between geologists and hydrogeologists. Therefore, geological complexity and understanding is often under-represented in many groundwater models. This article introduces a special issue of the Journal of Maps focusing on three-dimensional (3-D) geologic mapping for groundwater applications. Four articles in the issue are based on papers that were presented at workshops held between 2001 to 2005. The workshops provided venues for researchers to share their expertise in constructing 3-D geological models and to discuss various geological issues pertaining to groundwater and urbanization. Primary topics discussed in the workshops and in these four Journal of Maps articles are basin analysis, data integration and management, three-dimensional geologic model construction, groundwater investigations, and communication. The four papers in this issue demonstrate different philosophical and technical approaches to the development of GIS based 3-D geological models, while the modeling approaches and results reflect various issues and data support problems inherent with model development at various scales, from large regional models, to intermediate scale municipal and county scale models, to site-specific scale.},

Nowhere are these changes more evident than in the Great Basin of the western United States, a region of 400,000 km2 that largely is managed by federal agencies. Major drivers of ecosystems and human demographics of the Great Basin include human population growth, grazing by domestic livestock, extraction of minerals, development and production of energy, changes in fire and other disturbance regimes, and invasion of non-native annual plants. Exploration of alternative futures may increase the ability of management and policy to maximize the system's resistance and resilience to changes in climate, disturbance regimes, and anthropogenic perturbations. This special section examines the issues facing the Great Basin and then provides examples of approaches to predicting changes in land cover and avifaunal distributions under different management scenarios. Future sustainability of the Great Basin's natural and human systems requires strong, collaborative partnerships among research and management organizations that are capable of obtaining public support and financial resources and developing effective policies and institutional mechanisms.},

Biodiversity loss, range shifts, and phenological mismatches are all issues associated with a changing climate that are having significant impacts on individuals and ecosystems alike. Investigating and identifying effective management strategies that can conserve vulnerable species should be the focus of current and future climate change research. We investigated thermal properties of habitat for an imperiled grouse (Greater Prairie-chicken; Tympanuchus cupido) in tallgrass prairie characterized by heterogeneous fire and grazing (the fire-grazing interaction). We examined operative temperature at varying scales relevant to grouse and used historic and forecasted climate data to estimate thermal stress during nesting activities. We found that heterogeneous grasslands have high thermal variability with operative temperature ranging as much as 238 degrees C across the landscape. Grouse exhibited strong selection for cooler thermal environments as nest sites were as much as 88 degrees C cooler than the surrounding landscape, and fine-scale differences in thermal environments were nearly 48 degrees C cooler than sites within 2 m of nests. Additionally, forecasted climate scenarios indicate grouse will experience 2-4 times the number of hours above thermal stress thresholds, emphasizing the need for informed conservation management. Overall, these data provide evidence that variation in grassland structure resulting from the fire-grazing interaction may be important in moderating thermal environments and highlights the complex and interactive effects of restored ecological processes on ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In general, pentachloroaniline (PCA) biodechlorination is specific to the conditions of a system; such conditions include the type and concentration of electron donors and oxidizing agents as well as nutrient availability, pH, and temperature. In the bioremediation of contaminated sediments and soil, most researchers have focused on the ability of various electron donors to remove target compounds. However, the amended electron donors and the byproduct of the anoxic/anaerobic systems may cause more environmental impact. Therefore, methods for consistently evaluating the environmental effects of such electron donors and byproducts are highly needed. Accordingly, life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to estimate the environmental effect of PCA biodechlorination under acidogenic/methanogenic conditions through laboratory-scale experiments. Four scenarios, intended to assess the influence of electron donors on the environment and develop laboratory experimental research, were compared. In these scenarios, four compounds were used: acetate, lactate, methanol, and glucose + methanol. The LCA was carried out using IMPACT2002+ to estimate the environmental impact of PCA biodechlorination under acidogenic/methanogenic conditions. To add credibility to the study, sensitivity analysis was also conducted. In all scenarios, the technologies significantly contributed to respiratory inorganics, global warming, as well as increased the adverse impact of nonrenewable energy on the environment. Specifically, the emissions from the electron donor production processes played an important role in the scenarios. PCA dechlorination and methanogenic processes substantially contributed to the aquatic/terrestrial ecotoxicity and global warming, respectively. Optimizing the concentration of amended electron donors and increasing the population size of dechlorinating microorganisms are highly important in reducing the environmental burden by PCA bioremediation. Results showed that the methanol scenario was the most suitable option determined in this research. In addition, results indicate amended electron donors can cause fewer environmental impacts in carcinogens and noncarcinogens categories. By contrast, the amended electron donors can significantly increase environmental impacts in respiratory inorganics, global warming, and nonrenewable energy categories. Increasing the population size of dechlorinating microorganisms and optimizing the concentration of amended electron donors are highly recommended to reduce adverse environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {1. Culvert pipes are regularly used around the world for conveying stream flows underground, through embankments or under road crossings. Installation of these features can have significant negative effects on the passage of freshwater biota and potentially exclude many species from large areas of river networks. 2. We investigated the installation of mussel spat ropes as a potentially rapid and cost-effective tool for improving passage of freshwater biota through culvert pipes where internal barrel conditions impede passage. We assessed passage success for two fish species, juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum 1972) and adult inanga Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns 1842), and one migratory shrimp, Paratya curvirostris (Heller 1862), through culverts of differing length (3 and 6 m), slope (1.5 and 3 degrees) and flow (0.24 and 0.75 L s(-1)). We hypothesized that ropes would enhance the passage success of these three species, but success rates would differ between species and trial combinations. 3. Ropes resulted in a reduced water velocity within culvert barrels and significantly improved passage success for all three species. Shrimp benefited most by the presence of ropes, being unable to negotiate any of the pipe combinations in their absence, but exhibiting varying rates of success across all combinations with their presence. Both G.maculatus and O.mykiss were able to negotiate some of the non-roped pipe combinations, but as the level of difficulty increased, successful passage was only achieved with the ropes present. 4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that this relatively inexpensive and easy-to-install tool has the potential to substantially improve passage for a range of aquatic biota through various culvert scenarios. We consider that ropes would be particularly useful in situations where internal culvert access is difficult and where various culvert parameters (slope, flow, length) result in internal barrel hydraulics that would normally limit or exclude passage of aquatic biota.},

	abstract = {Aim The predictions from biogeographical models of poleward expansion of biomes under a warmer 2 x CO2 scenario might not be warranted, given the non-climatic influences on vegetation dynamics. Milder climatic conditions have occurred in northern Quebec, Canada, in the 20th century. The purpose of this study was to document the early signs of a northward expansion of the boreal forest into the subarctic forest-tundra, a vast heterogeneous ecotone. Colonization of upland tundra sites by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) forming local subarctic tree lines was quantified at the biome scale. Because it was previously shown that the regenerative potential of spruce is reduced with increasing latitude, we predicted that tree line advances and recent establishment of seedlings above tree lines will also decrease northwards. Location Black spruce regeneration patterns were surveyed across a {\textgreater} 300-km latitudinal transect spanning the forest-tundra of northern Quebec, Canada (55 degrees 29'-58 degrees 27' N). Methods Elevational transects were positioned at forest-tundra interfaces in two regions from the southern forest-tundra and two regions from the northern forest-tundra, including the arctic tree line. The surroundings of stunted black spruce, forming the species limit in the shrub tundra, were also examined. Position, total height and origin (seed or layer) of all black spruce stems established in the elevational transects were determined. Dendrochronological and topographical data allowed recent subarctic tree line advances to be estimated. Age structures of spruce recently established from seed ({\textless} 2.5 m high) were constructed and compared between forest-tundra regions. Five to 20-year heat sum (growing degree-days, {\textgreater} 5 degrees C) and precipitation fluctuations were computed from regional climatic data, and compared with seedling recruitment patterns. Results During the 20th century, all tree lines from the southern forest-tundra rose slightly through establishment of seed-origin spruce, while some tree lines in the northern forest-tundra rose through height growth of stunted spruce already established on the tundra hilltops. However, the rate of rise in tree lines did not slow down with latitude. The density of {\textless} 2.5-m spruce established by seed declined exponentially with latitude. While the majority of {\textless} 2.5-m spruce has established since the late 1970s on the southernmost tundra hilltops, the regeneration pool was mainly composed of old, suppressed individuals in the northern forest-tundra. Spruce age generally decreased with increasing elevation in the southern forest-tundra stands, therefore indicating current colonization of tundra hilltops. Although spruce reproductive success has improved over the twentieth century in the southern forest-tundra, there was hardly any evidence that recruitment of seed-origin spruce was controlled by 5- to 20-year regional climatic fluctuations, except for winter precipitation. Main conclusions Besides the milder 20th century climate, local topographic factors appear to have influenced the rise in tree lines and recent establishment by seed. The effect of black spruce's semi-serotinous cones in trapping seeds and the difficulty of establishment on exposed, drought-prone tundra vegetation are some factors likely to explain the scarcity of significant correlations between tree establishment and climatic variables in the short term. The age data suggest impending reforestation of the southernmost tundra sites, although the development of spruce seedlings into forest might be slowed down by the harsh wind-exposure conditions.},

This region is particularly prone to landslide hazards and, during the last 50 years, has experienced severe landslide disasters in the vicinity of numerous nuclear waste tailing dams. Due to its critical situation, the Mailuu-Suu region was and still is the target area for several risk assessment projects. This paper provides a brief review of previous studies, past landslide events and a discussion on possible future risk scenarios. Various aspects of landslide hazard and related impacts in the Mailuu-Suu Valley are analyzed in detail: landslide susceptibility, historical evolution of landslide activity, size-frequency relationship, river damming and flooding as well as impacts on inhabited areas and nuclear waste storage zones. The study was carried out with standard remote sensing tools for the processing of satellite imagery and the construction of digital elevation models (DEMs). The processed inputs were combined on a GIS platform with digital landslide distribution maps of 1962, 1977, and 2003, digitized geological and geographic maps, and information from landslide monitoring and geophysical investigation.
As a result, various types of landslide susceptibility maps based on conditional analysis (CA) are presented as well as predictions of future landslide activity and related damming potential and their possible impact on the population. For some risk scenarios, remediation and prevention measures are suggested.},

SDMs are inherently more complex when they include components of a species' ecology such as conspecific attraction and behavioral flexibility to exploit resources that vary across time and space. Wading birds are highly mobile, demonstrate flexible habitat selection, and respond quickly to changes in habitat quality; thus serving as important indicator species for wetland systems. We developed a spatio-temporal, multi-SDM framework using Great Egret (Ardea alba), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Stork (Mycteria Americana) distributions over a decadal gradient of environmental conditions to predict species-specific abundance across space and locations used on the landscape over time. In models of temporal dynamics, species demonstrated conditional preferences for resources based on resource levels linked to differing temporal scales. Wading bird abundance was highest when prey production from optimal periods of inundation was concentrated in shallow depths. Similar responses were observed in models predicting locations used over time, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Species clustered in response to differing habitat conditions, indicating that social attraction can co-vary with foraging strategy, water-level changes, and habitat quality. This modeling framework can be applied to evaluate the multi-annual resource pulses occurring in real-time, climate change scenarios, or restorative hydrological regimes by tracking changing seasonal and annual distribution and abundance of high quality foraging patches.},

We examined the reproductive and demographic performance of a rare Euroasiatic orchid (Cypripedium calceolus) at its southwesterly range limit and compared our findings with those of previous studies of nine central populations at the center of the orchid's range. We sought to test the central-marginal model and to evaluate factors involved in long-term performance of forest Eurosiberian species with peripheral populations in southern European mountains. We characterized (structure, temporal fluctuations, herbivory, reproductive success, and recruitment at different habitats) four Pyrenean populations of C. calceolus of different sizes (5-3500 ramets) and monitored three of them for up to 13 years. Two quantitative stochastic models (count data and matrix models) were used to assess population trends and viability and the effect of herbivory. Contrary to expectations, and despite the negative effect of sporadic events of herbivory, the peripheral populations we studied (except the smallest one) performed similarly or better than populations occurring in central part of the species' range in terms of reproductive success and population growth rates. Landscape changes over the last 50 years suggest that natural reforestation could be involved in the success of this plant at its southern limit. Forest expansion in the mountain regions of southern Europe may provide new opportunities for plants with geographic distributions centered mainly at higher latitudes and give some hope for their recovery in future scenarios dominated by biodiversity loss.},

In this study, we investigated long-term impacts of clear-fell logging on timber production and tree species diversity in a subtropical forest on the Ryukyu Islands, using an individual-based simulation model. We assumed six logging scenarios defined by combinations of forest type and regeneration processes, which acted as surrogates for spatial scales of clear-fell logging. These scenarios were simulated under cutting cycles ranging from 20 to 150 years. Short-cutting cycles resulted in dominance by the sprouting species Castanopsis sieboldii. The compositional shift was accelerated by the lack of seed dispersal from surrounding forest areas. The simulations demonstrated that a sustainable logging regime maintaining both yield and tree species diversity requires a cutting cycle longer than 50 years. The simulation results also suggest that the trade-off between the recovery of tree species diversity and timber production is favored more in stands surrounded by mature forest than in isolated stands or stands surrounded by immature forest. Ecological risk assessments based on model simulations provide an alternative to current forest management practices that rely on empirical knowledge.},

Thus, this study aimed to answer the following questions. How does the local population represent the possible changes in riparian vegetation over time? What historical events were responsible for these possible changes? How does the local population represent concerns related to the use and maintenance of riparian vegetation? This study was carried out with 87 informants from three communities: two rural ex-settlement communities and one quilombo in Northeastern Brazil. According to the informants, there were changes in the riparian vegetation. The main causes of these changes include the type of agriculture practiced in the region and the building of a large dam to provide water to the city of Sobradinho in the state of Bahia. However, there was no significant difference between the number of informants who said that the changes were for the worse and those who said that they were for the better. In addition, the respondents reported an increase in the abundance of exotic species and a decrease in the abundance of native species. Thus, the importance of including this group of people in the process of the forest restoration that will occur in the region is emphasized because they possess information about the past vegetation changes and their causes. They can also indicate which species should be prioritized for replanting according to their usage needs and they understand the importance of conserving riparian vegetation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the available information also shows that much remains to be done. Improvements in environmental quality have resulted in significant ecological recovery, including increasing populations of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcons (Falco columbarius), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.). Although this recovery is remarkable, many challenges remain, including population growth, transportation expansion, and land use changes; nonpoint source pollution; toxic substances contamination; habitat loss and degradation; introduction of exotic species; and greenhouse gases and global warming. Research/monitoring must be sustained for effective management. Priority research and monitoring needs include: demonstrating and quantifying cause-effect relationships; establishing quantitative endpoints and desired future states; determining cumulative impacts and how indicators relate; improving modeling and prediction; prioritizing geographic areas for protection and restoration; and fostering long-term monitoring for adaptive management. Key management agencies, universities, and environmental and conservation organizations should pool resources and undertake comprehensive and integrative assessments of the health of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie at least every 5 years to practice adaptive management for long-term sustainability.},

In the present study, we examine whether long-term fire exclusion leads to catastrophic fires and whether the fire regimes altered by fire exclusion have changed the course of natural succession of dominant tree species. We designed two simulation scenarios fire exclusion and no fire exclusion - and used LANDIS to study the long-term ( 300 years) fire regime dynamic and the succession of dominant tree species in terms of species abundance, age structure and spatial pattern. Our simulated results show that fire exclusion can lead to catastrophic fires with return intervals ranging from 50 to 120 years, increase the proportion of coniferous forests and decrease the proportion of deciduous forests, simplify tree species composition, and alter forest age structures and landscape patterns. Based on these simulated results, we suggest that prescribed burning or coarse woody debris reduction, uneven age management, and a comprehensive wildlife habitat suitability analysis should be incorporated in forest management plans in this region.},

Today, less than 1.2 million ha remain. However, over the past 10-15 years, public land managers have begun to restore many longleaf pine forests. More recently incentive programs have prompted reforestation and afforestation programs on nonindustrial private lands. These activities have been facilitated by improved longleaf regeneration technology and by expanded educational and outreach efforts. In the South, there is also a growing trend towards longer rotations due to changes in wood/fiber markets and prices. These trends suggest a new strategy to increase terrestrial carbon storage in the southeastern United States in a way that provides many simultaneous ecological and economic benefits. For example, longleaf pine is a long-lived species with a low mortality rate. Among the southern pine species, it has a high specific gravity and can tolerate a very wide variety of habitats. Longleaf pine is better able to sustain growth at older ages (over 150 years) and is tolerant to fire and many insects and diseases. Recent research also indicates that longleaf pine managed for longer rotations outperforms other commercial southern pine species on most sites and might better adapt to future climate scenarios with higher temperatures and higher atmospheric CO2 levels. Moreover, the higher-value, longer-lasting wood products derived from longleaf pine forests will continue to store carbon over long time periods.},

Due to the steadily increasing population, with improper land-use planning, inappropriate construction techniques and inadequate infrastructure systems, associated with an existing high hazard level, Istanbul is one of the most risky cities in the Mediterranean region. Estimations of casualties and losses, expected for given earthquake scenarios, are necessary to develop sustainable rehabilitation programs and for improving preparedness. Deterministic hazard scenarios and time-dependent probabilistic hazard assessment were used as input to a GIS-based loss estimation model, to evaluate the earthquake risk for Istanbul.
The deterministic ground shaking scenarios, used for loss estimation in Istanbul were defined in, terms of acceleration and velocity time series for recognized reference earthquakes caused by different rupture models along extended sources. The ground motions were calculated for the whole metropolitan area extending over a grid system of 25 x 100km(2).
For the case of Istanbul, the representative scenario was selected by comparing the simulated peak values and response spectra with the empirical ground motion models available for the area. Simulated values are within one standard deviation of the empirical regressions.
The availability of wide-ranging building inventory data allowed the application of a GIS-based loss estimation model (KoeriLoss-V2) to evaluate different loss scenarios depending on the ground shaking input, as well as to consider the implications of mitigation actions. It was found that 30\% of the buildings in the metropolitan area may be in need of either strengthening or demolition to achieve an adequate degree of life safety. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	shorttitle = {Managing for old-growth structure in northern hardwood forests},
	abstract = {Recent research in the northeastern United States has focused on "structure-" or "disturbance-based" silviculture. The as yet untested hypothesis is that these approaches can sustain a broader array of biodiversity and ecosystem functions than conventional systems. I am testing this hypothesis using a system that promotes old-growth structural characteristics, termed "structural complexity enhancement" (SCE). This approach is compared against two conventional, uneven-aged systems (single-tree selection and group-selection) modified to enhance post-harvest structural retention. The study is replicated at two mature, northern hardwood forests in Vermont. Manipulations and controls were applied to 2-ha units. The uneven-aged treatments were replicated twice; the SCE treatment and controls were each replicated four times. Structural objectives include multi-layered canopies, elevated large snag and downed log densities, variable horizontal density, and reallocation of basal area to larger diameter classes. The latter objective is achieved by using an unconventional marking guide based on a rotated sigmoid target diameter distribution, applied as a nonconstant q-factor. The marking guide is also derived from a target basal area (34 m(2)/ha) and maximum diameter at breast height (90 cm) indicative of old-growth structure. Crown release was also used to promote growth in larger trees. Prescriptions for enhancing snag and the density of downed woody debris are based on stand potential. Forest structure data, including Leaf Area Index (LAI), detailed measurements of individual trees, and coarse woody debris (snags and downed logs) densities and volumes, have been collected over 2 years pretreatment and 2 years post-treatment. A before/after/control/impact approach was used to analyze these data. Fifty-year simulations of stand development were run in NE-TWIGS, comparing alternate treatments and no-treatment scenarios. Basal area retention, relative density, canopy closure, LAI retention, and coarse woody debris volumes and densities were significantly higher under the old-growth silvicultural system. Residual diameter distributions achieved the target rotated sigmoid form. There will be significant differences in stand development based on the simulation modeling. Late-successional structural and compositional characteristics will develop to a greater degree under SCE. Large tree ({\textgreater} 50 cm d.b.h.) recruitment will be impaired under the conventional treatments, whereas rates of large-tree development will be significantly accelerated under SCE.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical work has established a positive relationship between resource availability and habitat invasibility. For nonnative invasive annual grasses, similar to other invasive species, invader success has been tied most often to increased nitrogen (N) availability. These observations have led to the logical assumption that managing soils for low N availability will facilitate restoration of invasive plant-dominated systems. Although invasive annual grasses pose a serious threat to a number of perennial-dominated ecosystems worldwide, there has been no quantitative synthesis evaluating the degree to which soil N management may facilitate restoration efforts. We used meta-analysis to evaluate the degree to which soil N management impacts growth and competitive ability of annual and perennial grass seedlings. We then link our analysis to current theories of plant ecological strategies and community assembly to improve our ability to understand how soil N management may be used to restore annual grass-dominated communities. Across studies, annual grasses maintained higher growth rates and greater biomass and tiller production than perennials under low and high N availability. We found no evidence that lowering N availability fundamentally alters competitive interactions between annual and perennial grass seedlings. Competitive effects of annual neighbors on perennial targets were similar under low and high N availability. Moreover, in most cases perennials grown under competition in high-N soils produced more biomass than perennials grown under competition in low-N soils. While these findings counter current restoration and soil N management assumptions, these results are consistent with current plant ecological strategy and community assembly theory. Based on our results and these theories we argue that, in restoration scenarios in which the native plant community is being reassembled from seed, soil N management will have no direct positive effect on native plant establishment unless invasive plant propagule pools and priority effects are controlled the first growing season.},

Understanding how stressors interfere and impact upon ecological status and ecosystem services is essential for developing effective River Basin Management Plans and shaping future environmental policy. This paper details the nature of these problems for Europe's water resources and the need to find solutions at a range of spatial scales. In terms of the latter, we describe the aims and approaches of the EU-funded project MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems and water Resources under multiple Stress) and the conceptual and analytical framework that it is adopting to provide this knowledge, understanding and tools needed to address multiple stressors. MARS is operating at three scales: At the water body scale, the mechanistic understanding of stressor interactions and their impact upon water resources, ecological status and ecosystem services will be examined through multi-factorial experiments and the analysis of long time-series. At the river basin scale, modelling and empirical approaches will be adopted to characterise relationships between multiple stressors and ecological responses, functions, services and water resources. The effects of future land use and mitigation scenarios in 16 European river basins will be assessed. At the European, scale, large-scale spatial analysis will be carried out to identify the relationships amongst stress intensity, ecological status and service provision, with a special focus on large transboundary rivers, lakes and fish. The project will support managers and policy makers in the practical implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), of related legislation and of the Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources by advising the 3rd River Basin Management Planning cycle, the revision of the WFD and by developing new tools for diagnosing and predicting multiple stressors.

Although few studies have examined their conservation potential, extensive planted forests cover a significant portion of North-American mixed boreal forests. We study the composition, functional assemblage, and vertical structure of understory communities in even-aged, mid-rotation, planted and naturally regenerated mixed boreal stands typical of extensive management (Quebec, Canada). Our results show that more than 20 years after harvest, species composition and functional assemblage still differ between stand types while understory structure does not. Planted stands exhibit a higher prevalence of traits and species typically associated with younger stands. Sensitive species such as Oxalis acetosella ssp. montana and Monotropa uniflora occurred less often in planted stands while the reverse was true for a portion of species with the potential to form a recalcitrant layer. This suggests that the understory of planted sites may require more time before reaching compositional and functional attributes comparable to those of naturally regenerated stands. This delayed maturation has implications for forest management, particularly under increased management intensity scenarios. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Lam. and Rhizophora mucronata (L.) among the larger Avicennia marina trees. This study tested the hypothesis that mangroves have expanded and replaced salt marsh over a 33-year period (1978-2011). It provides important information on mangroves growing at higher latitudes, where they were thought to not occur naturally due to lower annual average temperatures. It further provides insights on future scenarios of possible shifts in vegetation types due to climate change at one of the most southerly distribution sites worldwide. The expansion of mangroves was measured using past aerial photographs and Esri ArcGIS Desktop 10 software. In addition, field surveys were completed in 2011 to determine the population structure of the present mangrove forest and relate this to environmental conditions. The study showed that mangrove area cover increased linearly at a rate of 0.06 ha y(-1), while the salt marsh area cover also increased (0.09 ha y(-1)) but was found to be variable over time. The mangrove area is still relatively small ({\textless}2 ha) and expanded mostly over a bare sandflat area. Avicennia marina was the dominant species and had high recruitment (seedling density was 33 822 +/- 16 364 ha(-1)). Only a few Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Rhizophora mucronata individuals were found ({\textless}10 adult trees), although observations indicate that some young plants are becoming established away from the parent plants. The site provides opportunities for studies on mangrove/salt marsh interactions in response to a changing climate. Mangroves should not be planted in non-native areas as they may become invasive outside their natural range. However, future increases in temperature will certainly lead to a southerly expansion of mangoves in South African estuaries.},

The cockatoo population model was parameterised with mark-resight-derived estimates of survival and fecundity from 13 years of demographic data. Species interactions were incorporated by using a climate-change-driven bioclimatic model of Allocasuarina verticillata as a dynamic driver of habitat suitability. A novel application of Latin Hypercube sampling was used to assess the models sensitivity to input parameters. 3. Results suggest that unmitigated climate change is likely to be a substantial threat for the cockatoo: all high-CO2-concentration scenarios had expected minimum abundances of {\textless}160 birds. Extinction was virtually certain if management of nest-predating brush-tail possums Trichosurus vulpecula was stopped, or adult survival reduced by as little as 5\%. In contrast, the population is predicted to increase under low-emissions scenarios. 4. Disease outbreak, increased fire frequency and reductions in revegetation and management of competitive little corellas Cacatua sanguinea, were all predicted to exacerbate decline, but these effects were buffered by the cockatoo populations high fecundity. 5. Spatial correlates of extinction risk, such as range area and total habitat suitability, were nonlinearly related to projected population size in the high-CO2-concentration scenario. 6. Synthesis and applications. Mechanistic demographic-bioclimatic simulations that incorporate species interactions can provide more detailed viability analyses than traditional bioclimatic models and be used to rank the cost-effectiveness of management interventions. Our results highlight the importance of managing possum predation and maintaining high adult cockatoo survival. In contrast, corella and revegetation management could be experimentally reduced to save resources.},

	abstract = {Forest ground vegetation constitutes the largest number of plant species that participate in forest dynamics. Single species or species groups of forest ground vegetation can be used as indicators for site conditions. Ground vegetation has to be accounted in forest simulation modeling if biodiversity dynamics are evaluated to serve the purpose of sustainable forest management. The usual approach is to segregate ground vegetation into plant functional types. However, there are other methods that could be used. In our contribution we propose to split ground vegetation into ecological-coenotic species groups. An application of the ecological-coenotic approach allowed for a forecasting of the dynamics of forest ground vegetation diversity on the basis of forest ecosystem modeling outputs, standard forest inventory data, and regional phytosociological data sets. A new software BioCalc designed for the forecasting of dynamics of forest ground vegetation diversity, and the EFIMOD model of the forest growth and element cycling in the forest-soil system is used for simulating the forest ecosystem parameters under different forest management regimes.
An application of the proposed method for a study area situated in the Central European Russia is discussed. Two hundred-year dynamics of ground vegetation composition, forest types and species diversity is analysed under four forest management scenarios: NAT, natural development; SCU, selective cuttings; LRU, authorized by Russian legislation clear cuttings; ILL, non-authorized by the legislation but widespread clear cuttings. The simulation results showed that the total number of forest types is higher in all scenarios with cuttings relative to the NAT scenario. However, the NAT strategy leads to the growth of coniferous-broad-leaved forests close to the climax forest type of the study area. Cuttings hinder the development of climax forest structure due to the low level of deadwood in harvested forests and the absence of species-rich forest units dominated by nitrophilous tall herbs in the understorey. The NAT strategy leads to the highest species diversity in ground vegetation if a free forest development has taken place for rather long time, i.e. more than 100 years in the study area. The sum of species diversity is rather low for SCU, LRU, and ILL scenarios. It is 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, in comparison with the NAT scenario. The SCU scenario lead to a simplification of ground vegetation together with a conservation of nemoral and boreal species. Scenarios with clear cuttings (LRU and ILL) maintain piny and meadow groups in ground vegetation.
None of the forest management scenario leads to the maintenance of the whole set of ecological-coenotic groups in ground vegetation. Only a spatial combination of different management regimes in the forest area is necessary for the biodiversity restoration and maintenance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Gulf of Finland, the easternmost part of the Baltic Sea, has witnessed a rapid increase in oil transportation during the last 15 years. Should a spill occur, the negative ecological impacts may be reduced by oil combating, the effectiveness of which is, however, strongly dependent on prevailing environmental conditions and available technical resources. This poses increased uncertainty related to ecological consequences of future spills. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian network model that can be used to assess the effectiveness of different oil combating strategies in minimizing the negative effects of oil on six species living in the Gulf of Finland. The model can be used for creating different accident scenarios and assessing the performance of various oil combating actions under uncertainty, which enables its use as a supportive tool in decision-making. While the model is confined to the western Gulf of Finland, the methodology is adaptable to other marine areas facing similar risks and challenges related to oil spills.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial environment of the High Arctic consists of a mosaic of habitat types, both natural and anthropogenic. At the abandoned coal mining town of Pyramiden, Svalbard, topsoil was imported from southern European Russia. This, and further industrial disturbance in the town, offers new opportunities for the native invertebrate fauna, but may also introduce alien, potentially invasive, species. Few studies have examined anthropogenic habitats in the High Arctic. But increasing activity, including industry and tourism, requires an understanding of the responses of the Arctic to such pressures. The microarthropod communities observed in the settlement were substantially different from the natural tundra. In the settlement, nine species of mesostigmatid mite occurred (three new records for Svalbard; Dendrolaelaps foveolatus) and two additional not identified to species (Halolaelaps sp., Arctoseius sp.), 26 species of Collembola (12 not seen in the natural tundra close to Pyramiden) and two new records (Thalassaphorura debilis and Desoria tigrina), but only five Oribatida. This is set against 8, 20 and 24 species respectively for Mesostigmata, Oribatida and Collembola from natural tundra in the vicinity. The imported soils remain to be yet fully exploited by the native microarthropod fauna. Taxa disparities may result from differential mortality during collection and shipping of the soil, and subsequent colonisation. While none of the introduced species appear to be invasive, responses to climate change scenarios are difficult to project. Understanding of alien species and the timespans required for colonization by native faunas are of importance for remediation and reclamation projects in polar regions.},

	abstract = {Salt marshes continue to degrade in the United States due to indirect human impacts arising from tidal restrictions. Roads or berms with inadequate provision for tidal flow hinder ecosystem functions and interfere with self-maintenance of habitat, because interactions among vegetation, soil, and hydrology within tidally restricted marshes prevent them from responding to sea level rise. Prediction of the tidal range that is expected after restoration relative to the current geomorphology is crucial for successful restoration of salt marsh habitat. Both insufficient (due to restriction) and excessive (due to subsidence and sea level rise) tidal flooding can lead to loss of salt marshes. We developed and applied the Marsh Response to Hydrological Modifications model as a predictive tool to forecast the success of management scenarios for restoring full tides to previously restricted areas. We present an overview of a computer simulation tool that evaluates potential culvert installations with output of expected tidal ranges, water discharges, and flood potentials. For three New England tidal marshes we show species distributions of plants for tidally restricted and nonrestricted areas. Elevation ranges of species are used for short-term ({\textless}5 years) predictions of changes to salt marsh habitat after tidal restoration. In addition, elevation changes of the marsh substrate measured at these sites are extrapolated to predict long-term ({\textgreater}5 years) changes in marsh geomorphology under restored tidal regimes. The resultant tidal regime should be designed to provide habitat requirements for salt marsh plants. At sites with substantial elevation losses a balance must be struck that stimulates elevation increases by improving sediment fluxes into marshes while establishing flooding regimes appropriate to sustain the desired plants.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the impacts of changing climatic conditions on forest growth is integral to estimating future forest carbon balance. We used a growth-and-yield model, modified for climate sensitivity, to quantify the effects of altered climate on mixed-conifer forest growth in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. Estimates of forest growth and live tree carbon stocks were made for low and high emission scenarios using four downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections. The climate scenarios were coupled with a range of commonly-used fuels reduction treatments to quantify the combined effects of these factors on live tree carbon stocks. We compared mid- (2020-2049) and late-21st (2070-2099) century carbon stock estimates with a baseline period of 1970-1999 using common input data across time periods. Recursive partitioning analysis indicates that GCM, forest composition, and simulation period most influence live tree carbon stock changes. Comparison with the late 20th century baseline period shows mixed carbon stock responses across scenarios. Growth varied by species, often with compensatory responses among dominant species that limited changes in total live tree carbon. The influence of wildfire mitigation treatments was relatively consistent with each GCM by emission scenario combination. Treatments that included prescribed fire had greater live tree carbon gains relative to baseline under the scenarios that had overall live tree carbon gains. However, across GCMs the influence of treatments varied considerably among GCM projections, indicating that further refinement of regional climate projections will be required to improve model estimates of fuel manipulations on forest carbon stocks. Additionally, had out simulations included the effects of projected climate changes on increasing wildfire probability, the effects of management treatments on carbon stocks may have been more pronounced because of the influence of treatment on fire severity.

Planting trees in the riparian zone would be one of the alternatives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of several planting strategies on daily maximum stream temperature along the river. The results showed the effective vegetative shading angles should be more than 50 degrees along ChiChiaWan Creek to reduce the direct solar radiation heating effectively. Upstream planting with 70 degrees vegetative shading angle could be the most effective way among all the scenarios. However, this planting strategy could not improve the worst situations in summer because of the large solar elevation angles. The upstream planting in ChiChiaWan Creek was strongly recommended because the canopies could be easier to extend to totally cover the narrow width of river producing the most effective shades. Practicing the upstream planting with 90 degrees vegetative shading angle can increase more than 1?km long suitable habitats for the endangered Salmon in summer. Alternatively, the west-side planting scenario was the second effective way for temperature reduction. Our result provided a useful suggestion for the authorities in charge of saving the Formosan Landlocked Salmon, particularly under the stress of global warming.

Using four different channel management scenarios, our channel migration simulations suggest that: (1) channel stabilization alters the future channel planform locally and downstream from the stabilization; (2) rock revetment currently on the bank upstream from the Woodson Bridge recreation area causes more erosion of the channel bank at the recreation area than if the revetment were not present; (3) relocating the channel to the west and allowing subsequent unconstrained river migration relieves the erosion pressure in the Woodson Bridge area; (4) the subsequent migration reworks (erodes along one river bank and replaces new floodplain along the other) 26.5 ha of land; and (5) the river will rework between 8.5 and 48.5 ha of land in the study reach (over the course of 50 years), depending on the bank stabilization plan used.

However, due to lack of information and evaluation methods, there is no effective and systematic tool for assessing tradeoffs between direct human benefits and ecosystem services. Land use changes influence ecosystem properties, processes and components, which are the basis for providing services. Five alternative land use scenarios (no conversion of agricultural lands, no urban expansion, agricultural expansion, forestry expansion, and riparian reforestation) were modeled for the Baiyangdian watershed, China, a densely populated, highly modified watershed with serious water shortage and pollution problems. The model InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is designed to inform decisions about natural resource management, with an aim to align economic forces with conservation. Three ecosystem services (agricultural production, hydropower production, and water quality) were modeled to balance direct benefits and hydrological ecosystem services using InVEST. The results showed that: hydropower production was the greatest in the forestry expansion, but the lowest in agricultural expansion; agricultural production was reduced the most in forestry expansion, while retained the most in riparian reforestation. Riparian reforestation also provided the highest N and P retention and lowest N and P exportation. Riparian reforestation was the optimal land use strategy, since it protected and enhanced the vital ecosystem services without undermining direct human benefits. This research presents an initial analytical framework for integrating direct human benefits and ecosystem services in policy planning and illustrates its application. Although there are important potential tradeoffs between ecosystem services, this systematic planning framework offers a means for identifying valuable synergies between conservation and development.},

	abstract = {The opportunity for private landowners to receive carbon credits from reforestation, or "carbon farming," will change the relative value of land uses for landowners, potentially having an impact on land-use decisions. We constructed a spatial model to evaluate the potential scale and location of carbon farming in a New Zealand landscape, the size of resulting carbon stocks, and the economic trade-offs for landowners considering carbon farming. We modeled the carbon accumulation, economic value, and potential uptake of a carbon farming management system that utilized native forest regeneration on set-aside land. For the study area, the Gisborne District of New Zealand, we found that regrowth of native forest species on estimated Kyoto-eligible marginal pasture has the technical potential to store 104.2 Mt CO2-e over 70 years over 379,000 eligible hectares. We found 102,951 ha where the potential economic revenues from carbon in our most conservative scenario could generate NZ\$912 million in excess of expected grazing revenues over 70 years of forest regeneration. Our results suggest that reforestation could out-compete grazing on at least 27\% of eligible land in the Gisborne District. Sensitivity analysis shows that uncertainty about the scale of carbon sequestration can have a sizeable effect on the estimated profitability of carbon farming, but estimated land conversion is strongly affected by the choice of discount rates among landowners and the utilization of compatible incentives for other environmental services. Potential profits from carbon farming are strongly affected by the uncertainty of the future value of carbon credits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Agro-silvo-pastoral systems occupy much of the Mediterranean region. Promoting landscape heterogeneity in these systems is a potentially valuable management strategy to enhance woodland biodiversity. We evaluated the effects on birds of managing patches of olive groves and riparian galleries to promote heterogeneity of these systems in Portugal. For a large cork oak woodland we (i) used nesting season bird density estimates and habitat descriptors to generate suitability models for each studied species; (ii) identified areas suitable to establish new patches of riparian galleries and olive groves, and used this information to (iii) generate scenarios maps with different levels of cover of both habitats. Finally, (iv) the model of each bird species was applied over the future scenarios to estimate potential changes in its distribution and abundance. Future scenarios with greater availability of riparian vegetation resulted in major increases in projected populations of seven of the 21 studied species, but gains with increases of olive groves were predicted in just three species. Bird species predicted to increase the most with the recovery of riparian vegetation are presently among the least abundant in the region. Restoring riparian galleries would be highly beneficial for birds, whereas promoting traditional olive groves would have lower conservation implications. The methodology used proved helpful to select areas particularly appropriate for habitat management, generate simulated landscapes incorporating this management, and predict the population and spatial responses of species to these simulated scenarios, thus having a good potential to guide conservation management. Moreover, our results indicate that simple management measures should have substantial positive effects on the bird community of oak woodlands, without compromising the essential economic return of the system.

Its unique flood pulse system and annual flow reversal is a hotspot for biodiversity and productivity, as well as an essential habitat for many endangered fishes and birds. Despite predicted changes to the wetland's hydrology due to climate change and hydropower development in the Mekong, the consequent impacts on the fauna of the lake are poorly understood. A spatial modelling framework was developed to simulate the impact of potential scenarios of change using relationships between fauna and biophysical characteristics. Potential impacts on 61 animal species with documented nutritional, conservation or ecological value were examined. A large number of species rely on gallery forest to provide important habitats for their life history, yet this area is likely to be highly impacted by permanent inundation. There is a strong synchronicity between life histories and the flood pulse; consequently continued hydrological disruptions will have a significant impact on ecosystem dynamics, imposing further challenges to conservation. Protecting areas that may become suitable for gallery forests and shrublands under a modified flood regime will be crucial to management planning and the maintenance of a diverse and healthy ecosystem.},

With local stakeholders in the Pyrenees National Park area (France), we studied agricultural landscape colonisation by ash (Fraxinus excelsior) to enlighten its impacts on biodiversity and other landscape functions of importance for the valley socio-economics. The study comprised an integrated assessment of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) since the 1950s, and a scenario analysis of alternative future policy. We combined knowledge and methods from landscape ecology, land change and agricultural sciences, and a set of coordinated field studies to capture interactions and feedback in the local landscape/land-use system. Our results elicited the hierarchically-nested relationships between social and ecological processes. Agricultural change played a preeminent role in the spatial and temporal patterns of LUCC. Landscape colonisation by ash at the parcel level of organisation was merely controlled by grassland management, and in fact depended on the farmer's land management at the whole-farm level. LUCC patterns at the landscape level depended to a great extent on interactions between farm household behaviours and the spatial arrangement of landholdings within the landscape mosaic. Our results stressed the need to represent the local SES function at a fine scale to adequately capture scenarios of change in landscape functions. These findings orientated our modelling choices in the building an agent-based model for LUCC simulation (SMASH-Spatialized Multi-Agent System of landscape colonization by ASH). We discuss our method and results with reference to topical issues in interdisciplinary research into the sustainability of multifunctional landscapes.},

A semi-distributed, conceptual rainfall-runoff model was adapted to conceptualize the empirically-based, dominant hydrological processes of the study area and was multi-criteria calibrated using different objective functions and empirical constraints on model simulations in a Monte Carlo framework to account for parameter uncertainty. The results suggest that land-use change had relatively little effect on the overall mean annual water yield ({\textless}3\%). However, streamflow dynamics proved to be sensitive in terms of frequency, timing and magnitude of discharge extremes. For low flows and peak discharges of return periods greater than one year, land use had a minor influence on the runoff response. Below these thresholds ({\textless}1-year return period), forest cover potentially decreased runoff peaks and low flows by as much as 10\%, and non-forest cover increased runoff peaks and low flows by up to 15\%.

	abstract = {Many dams in the USA have outlived their intended purpose and an increasing number are being considered for removal. Yet, quantitative studies of the potential physical, biological and ecological responses are needed to assess dam removal decisions. In this paper, the responses of migratory walleye (Sander vitreus) to increased spawning habitat availability as a result of dam removal was studied by comparing scenarios with and without a high-head dam in the Sandusky River (Ohio), a major tributary to Lake Erie. A conceptual, ecological model was proposed to define the relationship between hydrodynamics and walleye spawning, egg hatching, larval drift and survival. A mathematical, ecological model of the early life-history stages was then developed and coupled with time series of depth and velocity predictions over the spawning grounds from a I-D hydrodynamic model. Model simulations were run for 1984-1993 for both the with- and without-dam scenarios to assess the potential benefit of dam removal. The simulation results demonstrated that velocity, depth and water temperature are major factors influencing adult walleye spawning success. Without the dam, 10 times the amount of spawning habitat would be available for walleye to spawn. This increase in spawning habitat area resulted in up to five times the total egg deposition and seven times the larval output to the nursing grounds, based on the assumption that 5\% of the walleye population of Lake Erie migrated up the Sandusky River to spawn. We concluded that the spawning habitat in the current condition (with the dam) is limiting and additional spawning habitat upstream could significantly increase the number of larval walleye drifting to Lake Erie. The model sensitivity analysis showed that the number of walleye migrating up the river in spring is the dominant factor for larval recruitment to the lake.

Models that integrate these factors are likely to better predict the outcomes of natural resource management decisions compared to those that do not take these factors into account. We demonstrate how Bayesian Networks can be used to integrate ecological and social data and expert opinion to model the cost-effectiveness of revegetation activities for restoring biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate our approach with a case-study in grassy woodlands of south-eastern Australia. In our case-study, cost-effectiveness is defined as the improvement in native reptile and beetle species richness achieved per dollar spent on a restoration action. Socio-ecological models predict that weed control, the planting of trees and shrubs, the addition of litter and timber, and the addition of rocks are likely to be the most cost-effective actions for improving reptile and beetle species richness. The cost-effectiveness of restoration actions is lower in remnant and revegetated areas than in cleared areas because of the higher marginal benefits arising from acting in degraded habitats. This result is contingent on having favourable landowner attitudes. Under the best-case landowner demographic scenarios the greatest biodiversity benefits are seen when cleared areas are restored. We find that current restoration investment practices may not be increasing faunal species richness in agricultural landscapes in the most cost-effective way, and that new restoration actions may be necessary. Integrated socio-ecological models support transparent and cost-effective conservation investment decisions. Application of these models highlights the importance of collecting both social and ecological data when attempting to understand and manage socio-ecological systems.},

This means that a large open peatland area of special ecological interest, known as the Green Heart, will be increasingly threatened by urbanisation. In this area diary farming predominates, and the ecological value is largely dependent on this type of land use (meadow birds).  Scenarios for future landscapes have been developed for this area, taking into account different potential spatial layouts of urbanisation. The consequences for nature were evaluated with a decision support system. The LEDESS (Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System) links available landscape ecological knowledge to a geographical information system (GIS) to evaluate the scenarios. LEDESS is based on a deterministic concept of the ecotope dependent on physiotope, vegetation dynamics, target vegetation and management, and of faunal habitat requirements which are also dependent on vegetation structure. It also takes into account the resistance of the landscape for migrating fauna species. It turns out that urbanisation will deteriorate the existing fragmented landscape. As an answer to the scenarios of urbanisation different options for nature restoration have been described in additional scenarios. The consequences were evaluated using the same computer model. The study has concluded that the negative effects of fragmentation can be compensated to some extent by enlargement of habitats, but the effectiveness of this depends highly on the spatial allocation of the new habitats.},

	abstract = {We present a land-use allocation model that evaluates the impact of payments for ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation on land-use patterns. In a non-linear optimisation procedure, land use is allocated at farm level, taking into account risk behaviour, and spatial as well as temporal variability of net revenues of land-use alternatives, using a spatial resolution of 29 m x 29 m. The model is applied to a study area of 30 km x 34 km in western Ecuador, considered a hotspot for biodiversity. In this coffee growing region, agroforestry systems with shade-coffee are important for biodiversity conservation at the landscape level, but under pressure due to low revenues. Through scenario analyses, we analyse the effects of price premiums per kg, payments per ha, and price buffering for coffee, as well as incentives leading to coffee yield increases, and payments per ha of forest remnants. We compare different risk aversion levels of the involved agents. We conclude that payments per ha are more efficient to maintain or increase coffee areas than payments per kg. Price buffering may be the most cost-effective way to support coffee production, especially at high-risk aversion levels. Significant yield increases are necessary to make coffee more attractive compared to the other alternatives. Relatively low payments per ha of forest can significantly increase forested land. Risk behaviour turns out to be an important factor when determining the possible effect of payments for ecosystem services. We conclude that the model is a versatile tool to support planning of payments for conserving ecosystems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For this purpose the 4C model was parameterised for natural regeneration of light demanding species and extended for management of multi-layered stands. A series of structural indicators was selected to describe key factors of forest biodiversity at the stand scale. Two consecutive aspects of Scots pine conversion were tested: (1) the choice of conversion strategy between thinning and gap creation and (2) the choice of conversion regime in terms of cutting cycle, thinning type and pine tree retention. Three simulated conversion strategies aim at the gradual removal of the pine canopy but differ in the spatial organisation of pine cuttings and hence result in different light conditions for regeneration. Only the directed gap creation strategy was able to maintain and increase birch admixture to the stand and to approach natural stand structural development. Simulation of 12 conversion regimes for the directed gap creation strategy indicated that thinning type (from above or from below), pine tree retention at final felling (50\% of the standing volume or none) and cutting cycle (6,9 or 12 years) all significantly influence stand structural development. These effects were clearest for oak development. Birch occurred in a few mixed clusters, but tended to disappear when-criteria analysis we conclude that the optimal longer cutting cycles were used. Based on a multi conversion regime - in which both stand productivity and biodiversity objectives can be combined implies thinning from above, pine tree retention, and cutting cycles of 6 years. The conceptual validity of the model as well as the applicability of the results are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Natural resources managers are being asked to follow practices that accommodate for the impact of climate change on the ecosystems they manage, while global-ecosystems modelers aim to forecast future responses under different climate scenarios. However, the lack of scientific knowledge about short-term ecosystem responses to climate change has made it difficult to define set conservation practices or to realistically inform ecosystem models. Until recently, the main goal for ecologists was to study the composition and structure of communities and their implications for ecosystem function, but due to the probable magnitude and irreversibility of climate-change effects (species extinctions and loss of ecosystem function), a shorter term focus on responses of ecosystems to climate change is needed. We highlight several underutilized approaches for studying the ecological consequences of climate change that capitalize on the natural variability of the climate system at different temporal and spatial scales. For example, studying organismal responses to extreme climatic events can inform about the resilience of populations to global warming and contribute to the assessment of local extinctions. Translocation experiments and gene expression are particular useful to quantify a species' acclimation potential to global warming. And studies along environmental gradients can guide habitat restoration and protection programs by identifying vulnerable species and sites. These approaches identify the processes and mechanisms underlying species acclimation to changing conditions, combine different analytical approaches, and can be used to improve forecasts of the short-term impacts of climate change and thus inform conservation practices and ecosystem models in a meaningful way.},

Whilst dehesa forest sustainability problems associated to exhaustive use of grazing resources have been indirectly approached by European Union authorities, providing support for artificial plantations over treeless land, no mention is made to natural regeneration techniques. In this sense, the formulated model allows for natural regeneration of already established ageing stands as a complement or even a substitute of actual reforestation practices. The proposed methodology is neither designed to determine optimal rotation of tree species nor optimal decorticating or pruning cycles of cork oaks and holm oaks, respectively. Instead, this information enters the model exogenously through knowledge of region specific silvicultural cycles for those commercially relevant tree species, and the optimisation program acts as an optimal land use allocator and thus a practical tool for policy analysis purposes. In addition to existing cost benefit analysis applications in dehesa ecosystems, the presented model allows in one side efficient evaluation of long term management dynamics -thus oak woodlands sustainability can be tested for sufficiently large time horizons-, and in the other, management decisions, instead of being forced through predefined scenarios, correspond to the optimal actions a decision agent would take from the complete set of feasible possibilities given actual land use and tree age distributions.

	abstract = {The St Lucia estuarine lake in South Africa forms part of a World Heritage Site and is an important local source of biodiversity. Like many estuarine systems worldwide, St Lucia has experienced significant anthropogenic impacts over the past century. Abstractions have decreased fresh water inflows from the lake catchments by about 20\%. Furthermore the Mfolozi river, which previously shared a common inlet with St Lucia and contributed additional fresh water during droughts, was diverted from the system in 1952 because of its high silt loads. The separated St Lucia mouth was subsequently kept artificially open until the onset of a dry period in 2002 when the mouth was left to close naturally. These changes and the current drought have placed the system under severe stress with unprecedented hypersaline conditions coupled with desiccation of large portions of the lake. Long-term simulations of the water and salt balance were used to estimate the occurrence and persistence of water levels and salinities for different management scenarios. The risks of desiccation and hyper-salinity were assessed for each case. The results show that the configuration of the Mfolozi/St Lucia inlets plays a key role in the physicochemical environment of the system. Without the Mfolozi link desiccation (of about 50\% of the lake area) would occur for 32\% of the time for an average duration of 15 months. Artificially maintaining an open mouth would decrease the chance of desiccation but salinities would exceed 65 about 17\% of the time. Restoring the Mfolozi link would reduce the occurrence of both desiccation and hypersaline conditions and a mostly open mouth state would occur naturally. Integrating these modeled scenarios with observed biological responses due to changes in salinity and water depth suggests that large long-term changes in the biological structure can be expected in the different management scenarios.

These new interactions result in novel communities, which are compositionally unlike communities observed previously, falling outside the conventional gradient of pristine to degraded ecosystems. For educators in college and university faculty in the ecological and design fields, two primary questions emerge in teaching restoration: how can design education engage landscapes not previously encountered, and how can educators and students acquire the necessary knowledge and experiences to be successful practitioners in no-analog communities? I first provide background about and examples of novel landscapes. I then describe the key complexities associated with novel systems made evident through research in the ecological sciences in order to understand the pedagogical challenges facing educators. I propose five pedagogical strategies that can facilitate exposure to and experience with the uncertainty and ecological dynamism that characterize novel systems. These changes include: making uncertainty central to the learning experience through creating future scenarios; using visualization and quantification technologies and playing digital game exercises; providing research opportunities for students through collaborations with municipalities and other experts, including natural and social scientists; and facilitating deliberations with ethicists, designers, and scientists about the political and ethical dimensions of interventions in hybrid and novel systems. I conclude with brief descriptions of three courses that integrate some of these pedagogical strategies while investigating novel systems.},

	abstract = {Question: The decline of the Pinus palustris ecosystems has resulted from anthropogenic influences, such as conversion to pine plantation forestry, agriculture and land development, all of which are closely related to increases in human populations. Other effects, however, have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes that maintain the structure and function of these ecosystems. How have alterations of the disturbance regime altered the physiognomy of 'old-growth' stands, and what are the implications for ecosystem conservation and restoration?
Methods: In contrast to models that emphasize close interactions among the vertically complex strata, we develop a conceptual phenomenological model for the physiognomic structure of Pinus palustris stands. We relate two natural disturbances (tropical storms and fire) that affect different stages of the life cycle to different aspects of the physiognomic structure. We then compare overstorey stand structure and ground cover composition of two old-growth longleaf stands near the extremes of different composite disturbance regimes: the Wade Tract (frequent hurricanes and fire) and the Boyd Tract (infrequent hurricanes and long-term fire exclusion).
Results: We predict that tropical storms and fires have different effects on stand physiognomy. Tropical storms are periodic, and sometimes intense, whereas fires are more frequent and less intense. Hurricanes directly influence the overstorey via wind-caused damage and mortality, and indirectly influence the herb layer by altering the spatial distribution of shading and litter accumulation. Fire exerts direct effects on juvenile stages and indirect effects on the herb layer via fine fuel consumption and selective mortality of potential competitors of P. palustris juveniles. These differences in effects of disturbances can result in widely different physiognomies for P. palustris stands. Finally, some global climate change scenarios have suggested that changes may occur in tropical storm and fire regimes, altering frequency and severity. Such changes may greatly affect pine stands, and ultimately entire pine savanna ecosystems.
Conclusions: Our phenomenological model of disturbance regimes in Pinus palustris old-growth produces very different physiognomies for different disturbances regimes that reflect natural process and human management actions. This model can be used to derive restoration strategies for pine savannas that are linked to reinstitution of important ecological processes rather than specific physiognomic states.},

Physical model testing covered a large number of configurations (including removal of bank riprap, and modifications of existing groynes), and gave assessment of bank erosion rates and extension risk for a large number of hydrological scenarios, including safety scenarios for exceptional floods. The proposed concept (riprap, groynes modifications) was implemented on O3 pilot site in spring 2013. First morphological and ecological responses to a recent flood that occurred in June 2013 have shown promising results, and promote duplication of such a concept erosion test on other additional pre-selected bank sites along the Old Rhine. A comprehensive monitoring program, covering both morphology and ecology aspects, is under progress to confirm relevance and performance of such a restoration plan, before duplication to other additional sites.},

Continued conservation as climate changes will require thinking differently about resource management than we have in the past; we present some logical steps and tools for doing so. Three critical tenets underpin future management plans and activities: (1) climate patterns of the past will not be the climate patterns of the future; (2) climate defines the environment and influences future trajectories of the distributions of species and their habitats; (3) specific management actions may help increase the resilience of some natural resources, but fundamental changes in species and their environment may be inevitable. Science-based management will be necessary because past experience may not serve as a guide for novel future conditions. Identifying resources and processes at risk, defining thresholds and reference conditions, and establishing monitoring and assessment programs are among the types of scientific practices needed to support a broadened portfolio of management activities. In addition to the control and hedging management strategies commonly in use today, we recommend adaptive management wherever possible. Adaptive management increases our ability to address the multiple scales at which species and processes function, and increases the speed of knowledge transfer among scientists and managers. Scenario planning provides a broad forward-thinking framework from which the most appropriate management tools can be chosen. The scope of climate change effects will require a shared vision among regional partners.

	abstract = {Alternative futures analysis can inform community decisions regarding land and water use. We conducted an alternative futures analysis in the Willamette River Basin in western Oregon. Based on detailed input from local stakeholders, three alternative future landscapes for the year 2050 were created and compared to present-day (circa 1990) and historical (pre-EuroAmerican settlement) landscapes. We evaluated the likely effects of these landscape changes on four endpoints: water availability, Willamette River, stream condition, and terrestrial wildlife. All three futures assume a doubling of the 1990 human
population by 2050. The Plan Trend 2050 scenario assumes current policies and trends continue. Because Oregon has several conservation-oriented policies in place, landscape changes and projected environmental effects associated with this scenario were surprisingly small (most \#10\% change relative to 1990). The scenario did, however, engender a debate among stakeholders about the reasonableness of assuming that existing policies would be implemented exactly as written if no further policy actions were taken. The Development 2050 scenario reflects a loosening of current policies, more market-oriented approach, as proposed by some stakeholders. Estimated effects of this scenario include loss of 24\% of prime farmland; 39\% more wildlife species would lose habitat than gain habitat relative to the 1990 landscape. Projected effects on aquatic biota were less severe, primarily because many of the land use changes involved conversion of agricultural lands into urban or rural
development, both of which adversely impact streams. Finally, Conservation 2050 assumes that ecosystem protection and restoration are given higher priority, although still within the bounds of what stakeholders considered plausible. In response, most ecological indicators (both terrestrial and aquatic) recovered 20–70\% of the losses sustained since EuroAmerican settlement. The one exception is water availability. Water consumed for outof-stream uses increased under all three future scenarios (by 40–60\%), with accompanying decreases in stream flow. Although the conservation measures incorporated into Conservation 2050 moderated the increase in consumption, they were not sufficient to reverse the trend. Results from these analyses have been actively discussed by stakeholder groups charged with developing a vision for the basin’s future and a basin-wide restoration strategy},

	abstract = {River floodplain landscapes are diverse and dynamic, yet little is known about long-term changes in land-cover patterns in these systems. We quantified floodplain land-covet change between the 1930s and the 1990s along nine 12-21-km reaches of the Wisconsin River by analyzing and, digitally classifying 200 historic aerial photos corrected against modern orthophotographs. Several metrics of landscape structure were used to determine changes in amount and connectivity of deciduous forest, wetlands, grassland, and agriculture within the 100-yr floodplain. Deciduous forest increased by up to 51\% between the 1930s and the 1990s. However, number of patches declined, and edge density increased in almost every reach, indicating that amount and connectivity of forest cover increased but that forest patches became more complex in shape. Grasslands declined, and the number, edge density, and mean size of grassland patches illustrated a progression to fewer, smaller, isolated remnants. Wetland patch dynamics demonstrated complex and divergent patterns, as wetland cover decreased in northern reaches, increased in patch density but not mean patch size in the central region, and increased in both patch density and patch size in the south. Agricultural areas declined in eight of nine reaches, and tended to fragment into fewer, smaller patches. These trends underscore a complicated and dynamic pattern of landscape change over a relatively short time. scale. We explored realistic conservation scenarios to determine how disparate strategies would affect floodplain forest connectivity in four of the study reaches. One approach filled gaps in the buffer zone immediately adjacent to the river channel; the other reverted small or large agricultural patches to forest cover. Filling buffer zone gaps resulted in dramatic changes in forest connectivity in one half of the reaches, whereas greatest forest connectivity was gained by reverting agricultural patches to forest in the other half of the reaches. These scenarios emphasize that the way that forest conservation occurs (e.g., filling gaps vs. patch conversion) is just as significant as how much land is actually protected, and the ideal management option must be tailored to the specific land-cover arrangements of a given river reach. In addition to evaluatitg changes in forest connectivity, the number of landowners that would be affected by conservation strategies was determined. Greatest increases in forest connectivity under the buffer scenarios involved. from 1.5 to 21 different landowners, whereas the greatest increases under the reversion scenarios affected from 14 (using several large agricultural parcels) to 67 (using many small parcels) landowners. Thus the number of landowners affected by different management scenarios represents a critical constraint on idealized conservation plans. Such scenarios may prove useful in floodplain management and facilitate synthesis of ecological research and land management.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are under global pressure. Habitat destruction and degradation persist despite longstanding recognition of the important ecological functions of mangroves. Hence new approaches are needed to help stakeholders and policy-makers achieve sound management that is informed by the best science. Here we explore how the new policy concept of Climate Compatible Development (CCD) can be applied to achieve better outcomes. We use economic valuation approaches to combine socio-economic data, projections of forest cover based on quantitative risk mapping and storyline scenario building exercises to articulate the economic consequences of plausible alternative future scenarios for the mangrove forests of the South Kenya coast, as a case study of relevance to many other areas. Using data from 645 household surveys, 10 focus groups and 74 interviews conducted across four mangrove sites, and combining these with information on fish catches taken at three landing sites, a mangrove carbon trading project and published data allowed us to make a thorough (although still partial) economic valuation of the forests. This gave a current value of the South Coast mangroves of USD 6.5 million, or USD 1166 ha−1, with 59\% of this value on average derived from regulating services. Quantitative risk mapping, projecting recent trends over the next twenty years, suggests a 43\% loss of forest cover over that time with 100\% loss at the most vulnerable sites. Much of the forest lost between 1992 and 2012 has not been replaced by high value alternative land uses hence restoration of these areas is feasible and may not involve large opportunity costs. We invited thirty eight stakeholders to develop plausible storyline scenarios reflecting Business as Usual (BAU) and CCD – which emphasises sustainable forest conservation and management – in twenty years time, drawing on local and regional expert knowledge of relevant policy, social trends and cultures. Combining these scenarios with the quantitative projections and economic baseline allowed the modelling of likely value added and costs avoided under the CCD scenario. This suggests a net present value of more than US\$20 million of adoption of CCD rather than BAU. This work adds to the economic evidence for mangrove conservation and helps to underline the importance of new real and emerging markets, such as for REDD + projects, in making this case for carbon-rich coastal habitats. It demonstrates a policy tool – CCD – that can be used to engage stakeholders and help to co-ordinate policy across different sectors towards mangrove conservation.

	abstract = {This paper presents results from a choice experiment (CE) study of anglers' valuations of the characteristics of an angling site at Storsjö-Kapell in the Swedish mountain region. In particular, the study presents value estimates of a dam removal and restoration to natural angling conditions. Values of catch, size and species are considered, as are values of bag limits. Also, value estimates are related to a trip frequency model, making it possible to predict visiting frequency under different scenarios. Thus, the model estimates provide a step towards developing dynamic fisheries management models, as the policies analysed may change the age structure of the stock. In addition to empirical results, the paper contributes a derivation of bounds on willingness to pay (WTP) based on the notion that new visitors may have smaller WTP for a change than those already selecting the site for angling.},

	abstract = {The goal of the Europe-wide conservation programme Natura-2000 is to ensure the conservation of both key habitat types and species. Natura-2000 articulates a Europe-wide vision, and the strategic level policy decisions will undoubtedly draw upon regional (national) statistics. At this time neither standardised methods nor funds have been found for essential recurrent small area monitoring. At this time neither standardised method for small area monitoring has been adopted, nor have funds been allocated for such efforts. We use an open raised bog in Austria's Salzburg Province as an example, and advocate a landscape analysis-based monitoring solution which can utilise historical data in combination with modern remotely sensed data sources, geo-visualisation, and landscape metrics analyses. In this paper, we augment a historical range of variability (HRV) assessment made from an aerial photograph time series with additional disturbance state representations created using photo-realistic visualisation. We introduce an object-based approach to historical/scenario landscape analyses and the use of a novel vector-based landscape metric tool. We assess the potential of structural metrics to assist in the quantification of site status by experimenting with several landscape metrics on the historical and simulated representations. The methodology is used to successfully quantify a trend of encroachment by heather and woody vegetation that is consistent with existing literature, and to provide a basis for further analysis. The landscape metrics applied show a marked increase in "bush-encroached bog" via the degradation gradient, as well as a decrease in the remaining core area of undisturbed "open raised bog". Results of a patch isolation analysis show an increase in both fraumentation and isolation of remaining patches of "open raised bog" area. Landscape metrics are useful for documentation of the structural consequences of changes in the bog, but must be applied with considerable care and rigor in order to indicate habitat conservation status. In our study, generalised landscape metrics evidence various deficiencies in terms of calculation or interpretability, ambiguity in interpretation, detailed species knowledge required for meaningful parameterisation, dependence on thematic resolution, and quality of the underlying classification.

	abstract = {Landscape connectivity is vital to the ecological health of many landscapes, and identification of linkages in working landscapes that are somewhat, but not irreversibly, degraded is needed. Assessment of the current ecological condition of habitat linkages can be used to determine appropriate management activities, including restoration. Forecasting the future ecological condition of identified linkages under multiple human-use scenarios can identify future patterns of vulnerability and degradation, and thus aid in prioritization of conservation and restoration actions. We forecast the ecological condition of a modeled conservation network of cores and habitat linkages in the San Joaquin Valley, California, a highly developed agricultural area. We assessed current and projected future impacts from modeled urban growth representing seven regional urban growth policy scenarios to determine conservation and restoration priorities. We characterized current ecological condition of the linkages using a clustering algorithm that compared vegetation type, length, and major road and canal crossings. The modeled urban growth forecasts were overlaid on the ecological network to identify expected impacts. A threat index was calculated for individual network components and for component clusters, and revealed significant impact differences between the various urban growth scenarios. The linkages most threatened by urban conversion were those that are currently the most ecologically degraded, suggesting that a significant future conservation issue in this working landscape will be the loss of restoration opportunities rather than loss of intact wildlife linkages. This study presents an approach for incorporating regional conservation design with urban growth policy analysis for working landscapes.},

In many cases this has induced a serious loss of biodiversity and reduced the potential to produce economic benefits for the local population from fishing, flood-recession agriculture, dry-season grazing and groundwater recharge. In 1993, in order to address the degradation of the Logone floodplain, the World Conservation Union initiated a floodplain-restoration project. In order to study the feasibility and effectiveness of a larger-scale restoration, a sophisticated one-dimensional hydrodynamic model was developed. This paper describes the results of modelling various options for this restoration under three climatic scenarios (good, average, poor). Results indicate that, for 'good' years, up to 93\% of the degraded floodplain can be re-inundated through a major adjustment of the existing infrastructure, without compromising other floodplain uses such as the irrigated agriculture and reservoir fisheries. The extension of model use for restoration assessment in other floodplains is also examined.},

With support from the Canadian Climate Change Fund, the Community-based Natural Resource Management for Carbon Sequestration project in East Timor (CBNRM-ET) was implemented to “maintain carbon (C) stocks and increase C sequestration through the development of community-based resource management systems that will simultaneously improve livelihood security”. Project sites were in the Laclubar and Remexio Sub-districts of the Laclo watershed. The objective of this study was to quantify baseline C stocks and sequestration benefits of project components (reforestation with fast-growing species, primarily Casuarina equisetifolia, and agroforestry involving integration of Paraserianthes falcataria). Field measurements show that mature stands (≥30 years) of P. falcataria and C. equisetifolia contain up to 200 Mg C ha−1 in above ground biomass, indicating the vast potential of project sites to sequester carbon. Baseline C stocks in above ground biomass were very low in both Laclubar (6.2 Mg C ha−1 for reforestation sites and 5.2 Mg C ha−1 for agroforestry sites and Remexio (3.0 Mg C ha−1 for reforestation and 2.5 Mg C ha−1 for agroforestry). Baseline soil organic C levels were much higher reaching up to 160 Mg C ha−1 in Laclubar and 70 Mg C ha−1 in Remexio. For the next 25 years, it is projected that 137 671 Mg C and 84 621 Mg C will be sequestered under high- and low C stock scenarios, respectively.},

This suggests that academic experts are available for advancing phytoremediation applications in countries where the majority of the effected population do not have the education, finances, and political leverage to obtain expensive conventional remediation efforts on their land.

A balanced strategy is required to achieve the contrasting objectives of remediation of land salinization and reducing salt export, while maintaining water supply security to satisfy human consumption and support ecosystems. This study linked the Catchment Analysis Tool (CAT), comprising a suite of farming system models, to the catchment-scale CATNode hydrological model to investigate the effects of land use change and climate variation on catchment streamflow and salt export. The modelling explored and contrasted the impacts of a series of different revegetation and climate scenarios. The results indicated that targeted revegetation to only satisfy biodiversity outcomes within a catchment is unlikely to have much greater impact on streamflow and salt load in comparison with simple random plantings. Additionally, the results also indicated that revegetation to achieve salt export reduction can effectively reduce salt export while having a disproportionately smaller affect on streamflows. Furthermore, streamflow declines can be minimized by targeting revegetation activities without significantly altering salt export. The study also found that climate change scenarios will have an equal if not more significant impact on these issues over the next 70 years. Uncertainty in CATNode streamflow predictions was investigated because of the effect of parameter uncertainty.},

Here, we identify a series of scenarios that may predispose terrestrial species to the need for assisted colonization in order to reduce extinction risk resulting from anthropogenic climate change and assemble a list of traits commonly associated with at-risk species. These traits may help to provide broad-scale guidance on how to select species to target for assisted colonization as a conservation management response to climate change. We also identify six key themes associated with successful conservation translocations including recipient site selection and preparation, a clear understanding of species biology and ecology, and taking lessons from invasive species research.},

The effectiveness of conservation investments in PES may differ under alternative policy scenarios and may not be sustainable because of uncertainties in human responses to policies and dynamic human-nature interactions. To assess the impacts of these interactions on the effectiveness of PES programs, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model: human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP). We used HANIP to study the effectiveness of China’s Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and alternative policy scenarios in a coupled human-nature system, China’s Wolong Nature Reserve, where indigenous people’s use of fuelwood affects forests. We estimated the effects of the current NFCP, which provides a cash payment, and an alternative payment scenario that provides an electricity payment by comparing forest dynamics under these policies to forest dynamics under a scenario in which no payment is provided. In 2007, there were 337 km² of forests in the study area of 515 km². Under the baseline projection in which no payment is provided, the forest area is expected to be 234 km² in 2030. Under the current NFCP, there are likely to be 379 km² of forests in 2030, or an increase of 145 km² of forests to the baseline projection. If the cash payment is replaced with an electricity payment, there are likely to be 435 km² of forests in 2030, or an increase of 201 km² of forests to the baseline projection. However, the effectiveness of the NFCP may be threatened by the behavior of newly formed households if they are not included in the payment scheme. In addition, the effects of socio-demographic factors on forests will also differ under different policy scenarios. Human and natural interactions under policies (HANIP) and its modeling framework may also be used to assess the effectiveness of many other PES programs around the world.},

	abstract = {Sewage sludges from urban wastewater treatment plants are often used to remediate degraded soils. However, the benefits of their use in metal-polluted soils remain unclear and need to be assessed in terms of factors besides soil fertility. This study examines the use of thermal-dried sewage sludge (TDS) as an amendment for heavy metal-polluted soil in terms of its effects on soil chemical properties, leachate composition, and the growth of native plant communities. To assess the response of the soil and its plant community to an increase in metal mobilization, the effects of TDS amendment were compared with those of the addition of a chelating agent (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]). The experimental design was based on a real-case scenario in which soils from of an abandoned mine site were used in a greenhouse bioassay. Two doses of TDS and EDTA were applied to a soil containing high Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd levels (4925, 5675, 404, and 25 mg kg(-1), respectively). Soil pH was 6.4, and its organic matter content was 5.53\%. The factors examined after soil amendment were soil fertility and heavy metal contents, leachate element losses, the plant community arising from the seed bank (plant cover, species richness and biodiversity, above/below ground biomass), and phytotoxic effects (chemical contents of abundant species). Thermal-dried sewage sludge emerged as a good phytostabilizer of Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd given its capacity to reduce the plant uptake of metals and achieve rapid plant cover. This amendment also enhanced the retention of other elements in the plant root system and overall showed a better capacity to remediate soils polluted with several heavy metals. The addition of EDTA led to plant productivity losses and nutritional imbalances because it increased the mobility of several elements in the soil and its leachates.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen pollution above a threshold level induces a eutrophication process in coastal creek ecosystems and consequently impacts on the water quality. The remedy for this scenario is the introduction of methods to enhance oligotrophication by means of constructed wetlands and buffer zones. This paper discusses new data on nitrogen flux and population changes in the primary consumers in the Bradley Creek ecosystem, adjacent to the Duck Haven Golf Course in southeastern North Carolina. In 1998-99, over different seasons, density distribution of the field populations of the fiddler crab Uca minax, was monitored as an indicator of environmental health. A control site at Whiskey Creek, adjacent to the University Center for Marine Sciences, was monitored in the same period since this site is not influenced by any golf course nutrient flux. The results pointed out that threshold level for optimum population density in Spartina grandiflora salt marsh is 0.1 mg/L of nitrates. A dense crab population, adjacent to the golf course with a buffer zone, was indicative of restoration of the estuarine ecosystem. A model, involving the use of constructed wetlands for oligotrophication, is being prepared on the basis of studies conducted by the University of South Alabama for a stormwater wetland constructed adjacent to the university's golf course.},

However, major successional changes are predicted for floodplain forests along the Mississippi River in the coming decades; young forests may replace the existing mature silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) forests in some areas. We wanted to assess how the breeding bird community might respond to these changes. We studied stands of young forests along the middle Mississippi River, comparing the breeding bird assemblages among three stages of forest succession: shrub/scrub, young cottonwood (Populus deltoides Marshall) and willow (Salix nigra Marshall) forests, and mature silver maple dominated forests. We recorded a total of 54 bird species; the most frequently observed species were the indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), and yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus). Bird species richness differed among the habitat types, with mature forests supporting the largest number of species and the most species of management concern. The shrub/scrub and mature forest bird assemblages were distinct and shared few species, but the young forests had no identifiable bird species assemblage, sharing species found in both of the other habitat types. The bird assemblages we observed in young forests may become more prevalent as aging floodplain forests are replaced with younger stages of forest succession. Under this scenario, we would expect a temporary local decrease in bird species richness and habitat for species of management concern.},

To counter this form of ecological abuse, there has been a significant increase of the number of restoration actions. This work approached stream restoration from a holistic point of view, combining habitat modelling with laboratory experimental research. A 2D hydrodynamic model was used to test the increase in weighted usable area (WUA) created by different boulder placement (BP) scenarios in a disturbed site, with a widespread potamodromous cyprinid fish – the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) – as the target species. This was complemented by experimental trials in a full-scale experimental fishway with different bottom substrata arrangements, in order to assess the effects of boulders on barbel movements. Results show that instream BP increases WUA for barbel and facilitates fishway negotiation. The findings reflect the importance of placing instream boulders in fragmented systems in order to enhance suitable habitat area and river connectivity. However, BP must be specifically designed for each case and should always be preceded by a comprehensive study for each site and target fish species.},

The BIG-SAFE is developed as a management tool to optimise mutual attuning of nature conservation policies and other interests in spatial planning. Fields of application of BIG-SAFE comprise designs and evaluations of physical planning projects, environmental impact assessments and comparative landscape-ecological studies. Taxonomic groups involved in BIG-SAFE are higher plants, dragonflies and damselflies, butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The development of BIG-SAFE was based on species characteristic of rivers and their floodplains, but the principles of the method can easily be applied to other ecosystems as well. The BIG-SAFE has been applied on behalf of a combined flood risk reduction and ecological rehabilitation plan for the Rijnwaarden floodplains (River Rhine, the Netherlands). Application to flora and fauna data available for this area showed that the BIG-SAFE method enables the user to express politically and legally based biodiversity values in quantitative terms and to compare biodiversity values for various taxonomic groups, landscape-ecological units (e.g. ecotopes) and physical planning scenarios, By linking habitat preferences of the species selected to ecotopes, the method also allows the user to derive relevant information at the ecosystem level. Because of its policy-based character, BIG-SAFE yields complementary information to more established ecological biodiversity indices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, to meet growing timber demands, it became popular over the last decades to establish plantations made up of foreign species such as Tectona grandis or Pinus spp. In the majority of the cases the species used are well known; their characteristics such as growth performance have been reviewed intensively and can be accessed in numerous publications. Characteristics of Panama’s native tree species of commercial relevance such as Hieronyma alchorneoides, Swietenia macrophylla and Terminalia amazonia are largely unknown and have been investigated within the study at hand. Using valuation methods of financial mathematics, the competitive position of these three indigenous species was assessed, the results compared to those of T. grandis stands in the same area. Land costs and taxes were not considered, as they would be the same for all species. Financial estimates for indigenous species will enlarge their acceptance for use in reforestation and plantation projects. Using the NPV method and applying the standard scenario, the profitability of T. grandis is lower than that of T. amazonia and S. macrophylla and lies only slightly above the profitability calculated for H. alchorneoides. This result clearly indicates that the investigated native tree species are comparable with T. grandis regarding their economic profitability. Besides its ecological impact, growing native tree species is now also economically legitimate. By calculating land expectation values for all tree species, ideal rotation lengths could be determined. For these species, considerable flexibility exists regarding the optimal rotation length.},

	abstract = {Conservation management is increasingly being required to support both the provision of ecosystem services and maintenance of biodiversity. However, trade-offs can occur between biodiversity and ecosystems services. We examine whether such trade-offs can be resolved through landscape-scale approaches to management. We analysed the biodiversity value and provision of selected ecosystem services (carbon storage, recreation, aesthetic and timber value) on patches of lowland heathland in the southern English county of Dorset. We used transition matrices of vegetation dynamics across 112 heathland patches to forecast biodiversity and ecosystem service provision on patches of different sizes over a 27-year timeline. Management scenarios simulated the removal of scrub and woodland and compared (i) no management (NM); (ii) all heaths managed equally (AM); and management focused on (iii) small heaths (SM) and (iv) large heaths (LM). Results highlighted a number of trade-offs. Whereas biodiversity values were significantly lower in woodland than in dry and humid heath, timber, carbon storage and aesthetic values were highest in woodland. While recreation value was positively related to dry heath area, it was negatively related to woodland area. Multicriteria analysis ranked NM highest for aesthetic value, carbon storage and timber value. In contrast, SM ranked highest for recreation and LM highest for biodiversity value. In no scenario did the current site-based approach to management (AM) rank highest.Synthesis and applications. Biodiversity-ecosystem service trade-offs are reported in lowland heathland, an ecosystem type of high conservation value. Trade-offs can be addressed through a landscape-scale approach to management, by varying interventions according to heathland patch size. Specifically, if management for biodiversity conservation is focused on larger patches, the aesthetic, carbon storage and timber value of smaller patches would increase, as a result of woody succession. In this way, individual heathland patches of either relatively high biodiversity value or high value for provision of ecosystem services could both potentially be delivered at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {The connection between fishery production and vegetated intertidal habitats often a key consideration in the rationale for protecting and restoring estuarine salt marshes. Evaluating the contribution of marsh habitats to estuarine nekton production requires an understanding of the mechanisms and constraints controlling production flows to nekton populations; this is especially important for setting and judging success criteria associated with restoration projects. This contribution considers both bioenergetic and landscape constraints on direct flows of marsh-derived production to populations of resident and migrant nekton. Nekton access to marsh resources is defined in terms of trophic (bioenergetic) and physical (landscape) constraints that determine the amount of nekton production that can be expected. Production to biomass (P:B) ratios applied to measurements of nekton standing stock from multiple marsh sites around Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA provided an example of the spatial variation in nekton production that can be expected from natural marshes. When P:B ratios of 2, 5, and 3 were applied to standing stocks of fishes, caridean shrimps and penaeid shrimps, respectively, annual net production of nekton from 12 intertidal marsh sites ranged from 0.12 to 2.88 g dry weight (dw) m-2 and averaged ca. 1.50 g dw m-2; other scenarios using different sets of P:B ratios yielded production ranges of 0.11 to 2.25 and 0.17 to 4.57 g dw m-2. There was a strong sigmoid relationship between nekton production and the amount of intertidal marsh/creek edge within a 200 m radius of a site for both resident and migrant species. Production was lowest at sites with relatively little marsh/creek edge, and increased rapidly with increasing drainage density until reaching an asymptote, after which even large changes in the amount of marsh/creek edge had no effect on nekton production. The findings suggest that bioenergetic constraints determine the ultimate capacity of intertidal marsh systems to produce nekton, but nekton production may be enhanced by relatively small additions of marsh/creek edge up to a threshold level above which no additional enhancement should be expected. Site-specific bioenergetic and landscape constraints should be considered when developing realistic expectations and success criteria for marsh restoration efforts aimed at enhancing estuarine nekton production.},

We looked at the ability of economic land-use diversification-with reforestation of tropical "wastelands" as a key activity-to halt deforestation at the farm level. Our ecological-economic concept, based on land-use data from the buffer area of the Podocarpus National Park in southern Ecuador, shows that stopping deforestation after 10 years is possible without violating subsistence demands. Tropical, farm-level diversification may not only reduce total deforestation by 45\%, but also increase farmers' profits by 65\%, because the formerly unproductive wastelands have been returned to productive land use. We therefore conclude that a "win-win" scenario is possible: the subsistence needs of people can be reconciled with conservation objectives. However, inexpensive microcredits (at interest rates below 6\%) and experience on alternative land-use opportunities must be offered to farmers.},

We modelled mammal population dynamics and used a risk-benefit analysis of contrasting management scenarios to identify the most suitable scenario given the complexity of objectives for West Coast National Park. Given the parks' dependence on annual flower displays to generate income and the ecological disturbance this requires, removing herbivore species that occurred outside their native range, removing fences, and reducing indigenous herbivore numbers was the most suitable scenario. We suggest that managers could use dynamic herbivore management models to guide them in achieving the suite of objectives they are tasked with.

More than 50 \% of the cerrado's approximately 2 million km 2 has been converted into pasture and agricultural lands and it is uncertain how the remaining areas will respond to increasing pressures from land use and climate change. Interactions between disturbance regime and resource (water and nutrient) availability are known to determine the distribution of the various plant communities, of contrasting structure and composition, which coexist in the region. We discuss how fire, nutrients and species traits regulate plant community responses to rising CO2 and global warming, exploring constraints to forest expansion into savanna environments. We describe how climate change will likely reverse a natural process of forest expansion, observed in the region over the past few millennia, accelerating tree cover loss through feedbacks involving fire and resource limitation, and counteracting expected CO2 stimulation effects. These involve changes in fundamental processes occurring above and below ground, which will probably also impact species performance, distribution and biodiversity patterns. We propose a conceptual framework for predicting changes on vegetation structure, highlighting the need for mechanistic models to accurately simulate vegetation dynamics under climate change scenarios. We conclude by explaining why an effective research agenda must necessarily include mitigation efforts, aimed at minimizing impacts of land clearing through enforced conservation and restoration policies in natural and managed ecosystems.},

Qualitative and quantitative species composition of disturbed vegetation shifted over time, making it more similar to that of the reference assemblages considered. Species density in the disturbed habitats increased, which is also a positive sign of recovery. However, eleven years after the clean-up was completed, canopy-forming macrophytes showed no signs of recovery. We argue that the ecological resilience of the ecosystem may have been eroded after a long-standing pollution perturbation and that underlying climate change could be influencing the recovery trajectory of the degraded assemblages.

	abstract = {A price on carbon is expected to generate demand for carbon offset schemes. This demand could drive investment in tree-based monocultures that provide higher carbon yields than diverse plantings of native tree and shrub species, which sequester less carbon but provide greater variation in vegetation structure and composition. Economic instruments such as species conservation banking, the creation and trading of credits that represent biological-diversity values on private land, could close the financial gap between monocultures and more diverse plantings by providing payments to individuals who plant diverse species in locations that contribute to conservation and restoration goals. We studied a highly modified agricultural system in southern Australia that is typical of many temperate agriculture zones globally (i.e., has a high proportion of endangered species, high levels of habitat fragmentation, and presence of non-native species). We quantified the economic returns from agriculture and from carbon plantings (monoculture and mixed tree and shrubs) under six carbon-price scenarios. We also identified high-priority locations for restoration of cleared landscapes with mixed tree and shrub carbon plantings. Depending on the price of carbon, direct annual payments to landowners of AU\$7/ha/year to \$125/ha/year (US\$6–120/ha/year) may be sufficient to augment economic returns from a carbon market and encourage tree plantings that contribute more to the restoration of natural systems and endangered species habitats than monocultures. Thus, areas of high priority for conservation and restoration may be restored relatively cheaply in the presence of a carbon market. Overall, however, less carbon is sequestered by mixed native tree and shrub plantings.},

	abstract = {The management of federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region changed in early 1990s when the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was adopted with the primary goal to protect old-growth forest and associated species. A major decline in timber harvest followed, extending an earlier downward trend. The historic and projected future change in carbon (C) stores and balance on federally managed forest lands in Western Oregon (OR) and Western Washington (WA) was examined using the LANDCARB 3.0 simulation model. The projections include C stores on-site, in harvested wood products and disposal and reflect a set of contrasting visions of future forest management in the region formulated as five alternative management scenarios that extend to year 2100. A significant and long-lasting net increase in total C stores on federal forest lands relative to early 1990s level was projected for both OR and WA under all examined management scenarios except the Industry Scenario which envisioned a return to historic high levels of timber harvest. In comparison with the Industry Scenario, the low levels of timber harvest under the NWFP between 1993 and 2010 were estimated to increase total C stores by 86.0 TgC (5.1 TgC year−1 or 2.16 MgC ha−1 year−1) in OR; in WA the respective values were 45.2 TgC (2.66 TgC year−1 or 1.33 Mg Cha−1 year−1). The projected annual rate of C accumulation, reached a maximum between 2005 and 2020 approaching 4 TgC year−1 in OR and 2.3 TgC year−1 in WA, then gradually declined towards the end of projection period in 2100. Although not the original intent, the NWFP has led to a considerable increase in C stores on federal forest lands within the first decade of plan implementation and this trend can be expected to continue for several decades into the future if the limits on timber harvest set under the NWFP are maintained. The primary goal of the NWFP to protect and restore old-growth forest may take several decades to achieve in WA whereas in OR the area protected from clearcut harvest may be insufficient to meet this goal before the end of projection period in 2100.},

	abstract = {The Grain for Green Program (GGP) is the largest afforestation and reforestation project in China in the early part of this century. To assess carbon sequestration in stands under the GGP in Southwest China, the carbon stocks and their annual changes in the GGP stands in the region were estimated based on the following information: (1) collected data on the annually planted area of each tree species under the GGP in Southwest China from 1999 to 2010; (2) development of empirical growth curves and corresponding carbon estimation models for each species growing in the GPP stands; and (3) parameters associated with the stands such as wood density, biomass expansion factor, carbon fraction and the change rate of soil organic carbon content. Two forest management scenarios were examined: scenario A, with no harvesting, and scenario B, with logging at the customary rotation followed by replanting. The results showed that by the years 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050 and 2060, the expected carbon storage of the GGP stands in Southwest China is 139.58 TgC, 177.50-207.55 TgC, 196.86-259.65 TgC, 240.45-290.62 TgC and 203.22-310.03 TgC (T = 10(12)), respectively. For the same years, the expected annual change in carbon stocks is 7.96 TgCyr(-1), -7.95-5.95 TgCyr(-1), -0.10-4.67 TgCyr(-1), 4.31-2.24 TgCyr(-1) and -0.02-1.75 TgCyr(-1), respectively. This indicates that the stands significantly contribute to forest carbon sinks in this region. In 2060, the estimated carbon stocks in the seven major species of GGP stands in Southwest China are 4.16-13.01 TgC for Pinus armandii, 6.30-15.01 TgC for Pinus massoniana, 11.51-13.44 TgC for Ctyptomeria fortunei, 15.94-24.13 TgC for Cunninghamia lanceolata, 28.05 TgC for Cupressus spp., 5.32-15.63 TgC for Populus deltoides and 5.87-14.09 TgC for Eucalyptus spp. The carbon stocks in these seven species account for 36.8\%-41.4\% of the total carbon stocks in all GGP stands over the next 50 years.},

	abstract = {North American fire-adapted forests are experiencing changes in fire frequency and climate. These novel conditions may alter postwildfire responses of fire-adapted trees that survive fires, a topic that has received little attention. Historical, frequent, low-intensity wildfire in many fire-adapted forests is generally thought to have a positive effect on the growth and vigor of trees that survive fires. Whether such positive effects can persist under current and future climate conditions is not known. Here, we evaluate long-term responses to recurrent 20th-century fires in ponderosa pine, a fire-adapted tree species, in unlogged forests in north central Idaho. We also examine short-term responses to individual 20th-century fires and evaluate whether these responses have changed over time and whether potential variability relates to climate variables and time since last fire. Growth responses were assessed by comparing tree-ring measurements from trees in stands burned repeatedly during the 20th century at roughly the historical fire frequency with trees in paired control stands that had not burned for at least 70 years. Contrary to expectations, only one site showed significant increases in long-term growth responses in burned stands compared with control stands. Short-term responses showed a trend of increasing negative effects of wildfire (reduced diameter growth in the burned stand compared with the control stand) in recent years that had drier winters and springs. There was no effect of time since the previous fire on growth responses to fire. The possible relationships of novel climate conditions with negative tree growth responses in trees that survive fire are discussed. A trend of negative growth responses to wildfire in old-growth forests could have important ramifications for forest productivity and carbon balance under future climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {Austroads and the Federal Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) engaged CSIRO, the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) Transport Research, the Monash University Centre for Population and Urban Research and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) to undertake a project to examine likely future climate change and population scenarios for the whole of Australia during the 21(st) Century, with the aim of investigating the effects on major road infrastructure, as represented by the Australian National Highway network. The project and final report titled "Impact of Climate Change on Road Infrastructure" (Austroads, 2004) was coordinated by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE). Climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on road infrastructure. Rainfall changes can alter moisture balances and influence pavement deterioration. In addition, temperature can affect the aging of bitumen resulting in an increase in embrittlement (cracking) of the surface chip seal, with a consequent loss of waterproofing. The result is that surface water can enter the pavement causing potholing and fairly rapid loss of surface condition. More frequent reseal treatments will ameliorate the problem, but at a cost to road agencies. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns can interact where higher temperatures increase cracking, compounding the effects of increased rainfall. The indirect impacts of climate change on roads are due to the effects on the location of population and human activity altering the demand for roads. Road infrastructure is a long-term investment. Roads typically have design lives of 20 to 40 years and bridges of 100 years. An understanding of the expected impacts of future climate change by road planners, designers and asset managers could engender considerable cost savings in the long term. At the broad strategic level, if road providers are forewarned of any costly likely future effects on existing infrastructure, they can better prepare to deal with them. The study compared pavement maintenance and rehabilitation costs for a year 2100 climate projection (based on a high emissions scenario; SRES A2) and "climate-adjusted" population projections, with present day levels, and determined the following major outcomes: Nationally, there is a small decrease (between 0\% and 3\%) in the required pavement maintenance and rehabilitation budget based solely on climate change factors. This result reflects the generally warmer and drier Australian climate (i.e. reduced precipitation lowers the rate of pavement deterioration). Annual pavement maintenance and rehabilitation budget is estimated to increase by around 30\% (considering both the influences of climate change and transport demand changes). There are significant regional variations in the change of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation costs as a result of climate variation and population and transport demand trends. For example, increases of over 100\% and 50\% are projected for the Northern Territory and Queensland respectively, due to the larger population increases and wetter climate expected within this territory and state. Limitations of the analysis include that the effects of weather extremes such as severe storms and flooding, which are projected to increase both in number and intensity (IPCC, 2001), have not been taken into account. Due to the computational requirements of the study, it was only possible to develop one high resolution regional climate pattern forced by one climate change scenario, instead of exploring the range of possible regional outcomes.},

	abstract = {A spatially explicit coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model was developed to study a coastal ecosystem under the combined effects of mussel aquaculture, nutrient loading and climate change. The model was applied to St Peter's Bay (SPB), Prince Edward Island, Eastern Canada. Approximately 40 \% of the SPB area is dedicated to mussel (Mytilus edulis) longline culture. Results indicate that the two main food sources for mussels, phytoplankton and organic detritus, are most depleted in the central part of the embayment. Results also suggest that the system is near its ultimate capacity, a state where the energy cycle is restricted to nitrogen-phytoplankton-detritus-mussels with few resources left to be transferred to higher trophic levels. Annually, mussel meat harvesting extracts nitrogen (N) resources equivalent to 42 \% of river inputs or 46.5 \% of the net phytoplankton primary production. Under such extractive pressure, the phytoplankton biomass is being curtailed to 1980's levels when aquaculture was not yet developed and N loading was half the present level. Current mussel stocks also decrease bay-scale sedimentation rates by 14 \%. Finally, a climate change scenario (year 2050) predicted a 30 \% increase in mussel production, largely driven by more efficient utilization of the phytoplankton spring bloom. However, the predicted elevated summer temperatures ({\textgreater} 25 A degrees C) may also have deleterious physiological effects on mussels and possibly increase summer mortality levels. In conclusion, cultivated bivalves may play an important role in remediating the negative impacts of land-derived nutrient loading. Climate change may lead to increases in production and ecological carrying capacity as long as the cultivated species can tolerate warmer summer conditions.},

Many Native American tribes eat more fish than the general population, especially in areas such as the Columbia River Basin, which was renowned for abundant fish. However, contemporary fish consumption rates are lower (i.e., they have been suppressed) than baseline heritage rates due to contamination, habitat degradation, loss of access, and legal and physical assault on tribal fishing. Nevertheless, traditional lifestyles are recognized and protected by intergovernmental treaties and/or aboriginal rights. The understanding of heritage rates is gaining importance as tribal cultures are reinvigorated, watersheds are restored, and understanding and respect for tribal lifeways improves. We compare the different methods used to derive Columbia Basin contemporary and heritage fish consumption rates. We highlight the need for caution in selecting a fish consumption rate until the derivation and context of the rate have been considered.},

Restoration efforts are complicated by the presence of multiple body forms (i.e., morphotypes) of Lake Trout that differ in habitat utilization, prey consumption, lipid storage, and spawning preferences. Bioenergetics models constitute one tool that is used to help inform management and restoration decisions; however, bioenergetic differences among morphotypes have not been evaluated. The goal of this research was to investigate bioenergetic differences between two actively stocked morphotypes: lean and humper Lake Trout. We measured consumption and respiration rates across a wide range of temperatures (4–22°C) and size-classes (5–100 g) to develop bioenergetics models for juvenile Lake Trout. Bayesian estimation was used so that uncertainty could be propagated through final growth predictions. Differences between morphotypes were minimal, but when present, the differences were temperature and weight dependent. Basal respiration did not differ between morphotypes at any temperature or size-class. When growth and consumption differed between morphotypes, the differences were not consistent across the size ranges tested. Management scenarios utilizing the temperatures presently found in the Great Lakes (e.g., predicted growth at an average temperature of 11.7°C and 14.4°C during a 30-d period) demonstrated no difference in growth between the two morphotypes. Due to a lack of consistent differences between lean and humper Lake Trout, we developed a model that combined data from both morphotypes. The combined model yielded results similar to those of the morphotype-specific models, suggesting that accounting for morphotype differences may not be necessary in bioenergetics modeling of lean and humper Lake Trout.},

The analysis of various interventions shows that both projects present high carbon mitigation potential. However, the carbon reversibility risk is lower in long rotation pine and mixed species plantation on community lands. The project is financially viable though not highly lucrative but the carbon mitigation potential in this restoration of degraded lands type of project is immense provided challenges in the initial phase are adequately overcome. Carbon revenue is an essential driver for investors in community projects. The short rotation timber species such as Eucalyptus, Poplar have high internal rates of return (IRR) and high carbon benefit reversibility potential due to fluctuations in market prices of commodities produced. The land holdings are small and bundling is desired for projects to achieve economies of scale. The methodological concerns such as sampling intensities, monitoring methodologies, sharing of benefits with communities and bundling arrangements for projects need further research to make these projects viable.},

	abstract = {Climate change in California is altering habitat conditions for many species and exacerbating stress from other factors such as alien invasive species, pollution, and habitat fragmentation. However, the current legal and planning framework for species protection does not explicitly take climate change into account. The regulatory framework is primarily reactive, kicking in only after species' health is gravely threatened. Neither federal nor state regulations require forward-looking, climate-sensitive species or ecosystem protection plans. Habitat planning is poorly funded and often piecemeal. In this context, the wrong lands may be protected, with development allowed to occur in areas that would be most beneficial for species conservation in the future. A more forward-looking approach to habitat conservation is needed, one based on a statewide strategy to identify and protect critical habitat areas, including corridors to enable species migration. The approach would also require development of assessment indicators and assistance strategies not dependent on current habitat structure, and a governance structure to implement regular, periodic updates of management plans in relation to agreed-upon performance indicators. Such a strategy should integrate habitat conservation planning with other state and regional plans and objectives, such as for transportation infrastructure, urban development, and mitigation of climate change.},

We use geomorphic and biological analyses to estimate restoration potential under three alternative scenarios for a 64-km section of the Trinity River, California, between the North Fork Trinity River and Lewiston Dam, which is the focus of habitat rehabilitation efforts under the Trinity River Restoration Program. The three scenarios are (1) increasing habitat quality by wood additions and alcove construction, (2) increasing habitat quantity by increasing sinuosity and side-channel length, and (3) increasing both habitat quality and quantity. For each scenario, we used existing stream habitat and juvenile salmonid data from previous studies to estimate potential improvements in fry or pre-smolt production. The potential increase in Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) and O. mykiss (steelhead) fry rearing capacity was 62 and 67\%, respectively, for Scenario 1 (increasing habitat quality), and 36 and 44\% for Scenario 2 (increasing habitat quantity). Only the most optimistic Scenario 3 (increasing both habitat quality and quantity) more than doubles potential juvenile salmonid production (112\% increase in Chinook fry capacity and 107\% increase in steelhead fry capacity). These quantitative predictions are useful in developing realistic restoration targets and evaluating whether proposed restoration actions can achieve the aims of a restoration program.},

	abstract = {One of the main adaptation strategies to global change scenarios, aiming to preserve ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, is to maximize ecosystem resilience. The resilience of a species metapopulation can be improved by facilitating connectivity between local populations, which will prevent demographic stochasticity and inbreeding. This investigation estimated the degree of connectivity among estuarine species along the north-eastern Iberian coast, in order to assess community vulnerability to global change scenarios. To address this objective, two connectivity proxy types have been used based upon genetic and ecological drift processes: 1) DNA markers for the bivalve cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and seagrass Zostera noltei, and 2) the decrease in the number of species shared between two sites with geographic distance. Neutral biodiversity theory predicts that dispersal limitation modulates this decrease, and this has been explored in estuarine plants and macroinvertebrates. Results indicate dispersal limitation for both saltmarsh plants and seagrass beds community and Z. noltei populations; this suggests they are especially vulnerable to expected climate changes on their habitats. In contrast, unstructured spatial pattern found in macroinvertebrate communities and in C. edule genetic populations in the area suggests that estuarine soft-bottom macroinvertebrates with planktonic larval dispersal strategies may have a high resilience capacity to moderate changes within their habitats. Our findings allow environmental managers to prioritize the most vulnerable species and habitats to be restored.},

	abstract = {Flood-control levees are generally thought to increase flood height and velocity for a given discharge. While extensive areas of floodplain in the United States are leveed, the ecological impacts of levees have largely been ignored relative to other anthropogenic impacts to large river floodplains. We examined a century of flood control along the Wisconsin River by comparing simulated flood regimes under "levee" and "levee-removal" scenarios. We also used field sampling to determine if levees had altered the distribution of dominant floodplain forest trees. Increases in flood stage (height) due to levees were minor, only a few centimeters. This was primarily due to the location of the levees, set back hundreds of meters into the floodplain in some areas. Increases in overbank flood velocities due to levees were minimal compared to increases caused by channel constriction and by increased flood magnitude. Generally, levees had a greater impact on stage and overbank flood velocities of larger magnitude events. The mean number of floods and number of days flooded were lower in areas outside (on upland sides) of levees, and stream power was zero in these areas due to a lack of any inundation. These areas also had lower importance values (IV) for several flood-tolerant tree species (Acer saccharinum and Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and higher IVs for some flood-intolerant species (Quercus velutina and Q. ellipsoidalis). Furthermore, areas inside levees (between the levee land the channel) were no different from completely unleveed areas in the number of floods, number of days, flooded and in INS of several dominant tree species. The levee location (set back into the floodplain) resulted in a similar historic flood regime, and thus, similar abundances of floodplain tree species in areas inside levees as compared to completely unleveed areas. Setback levees can provide an important compromise by maintaining the relative abundance of tree species normally found in unleveed areas, while also allowing some flood control. Floodplain restoration involving levee removal should generally target the removal of mainline levees (those adjacent to the channel) rather than removal of setback levees.},

Restoration and management of degraded pine savanna ecosystems is critical. Identification of ecological processes that determine the structure and function of the intact system are important because successful restoration efforts should be based on sound scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce this special issue on the ecology, conservation, and restoration of the Pinus palustris ecosystem. Some global climate change scenarios have suggested that future changes may occur that alter frequency and severity of disturbances such as fires and hurricanes. Such changes may have large effects on pine stands, and ultimately entire Pinus palustris savanna ecosystems, thus presenting further challenges to their sustainable management.},

	abstract = {Introduction Schizophrenia is a disorder that causes significant disability In addition, its treatment is expensive because the increased prescription of atypical antipsychotics with associated high costs In a recent 14-country study on disability associated with physical and mental conditions, active psychosis was ranked the third most disabling condition in general population, more than paraplegia and blindness. In the global burden of disease study, schizophrenia accounted for 1 1\% of the total Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 2 8\% of Years of lived with disability (YLDs) The economic cost of schizophrenia for society is also high The study of the burden of schizophrenia for society, whether expressed in epidemiological or costs terms, is an insufficient basis for setting priorities for resources allocation Thus, increasingly sophisticated economic models have been developed Such is the case of cost-effectiveness studies, which show the relationship between resources used (costs) and benefit achieved (effectiveness) of an intervention compared with others In Mexico, there is only one study that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia, but it was a specific approach (not generalized), and did not include psychological interventions The present study is part of a World Health Organization's initiative labeled WHO-CHOICE CHOosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective WHO-CHOICE methodology involves the evaluation of interventions based on a generalized measure DALY;, which allows carrying out several and important comparisons The main obiective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia in Mexican communitarian settings Method Schizophrenia was modeled as a serious chronic disorder with a high level of disability, excess mortality from natural and unnatural causes, and a low rate of remission The incidence, prevalence, and the fatality rate were estimated based on the study of the Global Burden of Disease and a review of the epidemiological literature As the first episode of schizophrenia is currently not preventable, the occurrence represents how the epidemiological situation would be without intervention In relation to the referral and the fatality, we did not found evidence that these rates change by a specific effect of the treatment, thus, they were kept as constants for the scenarios with or without treatment Community-level interventions assessed were 1 typical traditional antipsychotics (haloperidol), 2 new atypical antipsychotics (risperidone), 3 traditional antipsychotics + psychosocial treatment (family therapy, social skills training and cognitive behavioral therapy), 4 new anlipsychotics + psychosocial treatment, 5 traditional antipsychotics + psychosocial treatment + case management, and 6 new anlipsychotics + psychosocial treatment + case management The effectiveness of the treatments referred to the control of positive and negative symptoms and associated levels of disability To calculate the improvement in disability compared with natural history (when the disease is not treated), the effect sizes reported in controlled clinical trials were converted to a weight change of disability Efficacy and extrapyramidal effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics compared to placebo were estimated from the meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials, with the score of the BPRS severity scale and the need anti-Parkinson drugs as efficacy measures. From another meta-analysis we obtained an estimate of the magnitude of the effect by adding psychosocial interventions As an ad hoc Cochrane systematic review that found case management did not had a significant impact on clinical or psychosocial outcomes, only a minimal addition effect size when added to the combination of pharmacologic-psychosocial treatment was observed Costs included those of the patient, the program and the training required to implement the intervention. The provision of community-based services, daily administration of antipsychotics and anticholinergics, and laboratory tests were taken into account For psychological interventions were envisaged from 6 to 12 sessions in primary care from 6 to 12 visits, in outpatients services a visit per month for 20-50\% of cases, and in day care communitarian attention from 1-2 times a week for 20-50\% of cases A 3\% discount by the process of converting future values to present ones and an age adjustment giving less weight to year lived by young were included Finally, the cost of DALYs averted for each intervention was estimated to determine their cost-effectiveness Results The main findings of the study are, in relation to the costs of interventions: 1 the largest share corresponds to those generated by medication, 2 the current intervention is the cheapest, and 3 the combination of new atypical antipsychotics, psychological treatment and proactive case management is the most expensive intervention Concerning the effectiveness of interventions, the one available today, with a coverage of 50\%, prevents 68 222 DALYs Increasing coverage to 80\%, the number of DALYs averted is almost doubled with the use of typical antipsychotics The effect of psychological interventions makes the number of DALYs averted three to four times higher. Finally, in regard to cost effectiveness, the combination of typical antipsychotics, psychosocial intervention and proactive case management was the treatment with the best relation The cost per DALY averted was 5390,892 Mexican pesos, which corresponds to one third of the cost of DALY averted in the current scenario (\$1,313,120 Mexican pesos) Conclusions The resources for the attention of a public health issue involve a social investment rather than an expense budget, but they are also finite and must be chosen properly to be allocated Cost-effectiveness studies of available interventions are an essential tool for making such important decisions Our Mexican study of cost-effectiveness of interventions to treat schizophrenia in communitarian settings suggests, in general terms 1 That while the current situation is the one with the lowest cast, it is the least efficient, 2. all alternatives involve an additional cost to the current situation because they assume an expansion of coverage, however, the extra cost in not excessive, and 3) that within a model of community-based care, the least expensive option is treatment with typical antipsychotics combined with psychological intervention Thus, for a modest extra cost it is possible to yield a major Impact on disability Recently, the Mexican Federal Government has included schizophrenia in the catalog of diseases covered by the program called "Seguro Popular", that provides a health insurance to general population, especially to the poorest and unemployed ones. The planned actions include four specialty consultations in an interval of two months and annual psychopharmacological treatment Clearly the addition of haloperidol, trifluoperazine and risperidone to the list of available medications should be considered a success However, schizophrenia also requires a proactive case monitoring of long-term for best control of symptoms and a successful rehabilitation Moreover, consistent with our findings, case management has proven to be cost-effective when compared with routine core in the community. Among the limitations of the study it is important to note that it was based on modeled parameters obtained from the international literature In this sense, the challenge is the data generation directly from studies in Mexico},

	abstract = {Several plans for ecological rehabilitation and infrastructure facilities have recently been drawn up for the floodplains along the middle reach of the river Waal, a Dutch branch of the river Rhine. Three scenarios project expectations onto the future riverine landscape in 2015, called the preserving, saving and utilising scenarios. The preserving scenario only implies ecological rehabilitation. In the utilising scenario, the available space is largely used for human purposes and all ecological rehabilitation plans and infrastructure facilities are implemented in accordance with their 'worst' spatial alternatives. In the saving scenario, available space is spared as a non-renewable resource and ecological rehabilitation and infrastructure facilities are implemented in accordance with their 'best' spatial alternatives. In the preserving scenario, the natural landscape is safeguarded against new infrastructure facilities and only ecological rehabilitation is implemented. This paper describes the cumulative impact of the scenarios on the distribution and surface area of riverine ecotopes. Algorithms predicting species distributions based on habitat suitability were used within a geographical information system (GIS) to identify the impact of all floodplain reconstruction plans on the potential occupation of riverine ecotopes by (core) populations of nine focal species for Dutch river management. This impact may be extremely favourable for Nymphoides peltata, Gomphus flavipes, Gomphus pulchellus, Acrocephalus arundinaceus and Bufo calamita, but may be adverse for Triturus cristatus, Charadrius dubius, Riparia riparia and Phalacrocorax carbo. The utilising scenario appears to have a greater impact than the other scenarios. Implementation of plans in accordance with the preserving scenario seems to favour a more balanced settlement of species. The saving scenario occupies an intermediate position between the other two. Species that will thrive from future developments are those that prefer young, dynamic environments (e.g. side-channels), whereas species that will encounter difficulties are more related to mature environments (e.g. lakes and isolated river channels). Although many assumptions have been made, the results should facilitate the debate about and the decision-making process for policy targets of integrated river management.},

They play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, harbour a large part of the world's biodiversity, and provide multiple services to humankind. However, pressure in the form of land reclamation, intense resource exploitation, changes in hydrology, and pollution threaten wetlands on all continents. Depending on the region, 30-90 \% of the world's wetlands have already been destroyed or strongly modified in many countries with no sign of abatement. Climate change scenarios predict additional stresses on wetlands, mainly because of changes in hydrology, temperature increases, and a rise in sea level. Yet, intact wetlands play a key role as buffers in the hydrological cycle and as sinks for organic carbon, counteracting the effects of the increase in atmospheric CO2. Eight chapters comprising this volume of Aquatic Sciences analyze the current ecological situation and the use of the wetlands in major regions of the world in the context of global climate change.

The transition from centralized to market-oriented economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after 1989 represented major economic and political changes, yet the resulting rates and spatial pattern of post-socialist farmland abandonment remain largely unknown. Remote sensing offers unique opportunities to map farmland abandonment, but automated assessments are challenging because phenology and crop types often vary substantially. We developed a change detection method based on support vector machines (SVM) to map farmland abandonment in the border triangle of Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine in the Carpathians from Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 1986, 1988, and 2000. Our SVM-based approach yielded an accurate change map (overall accuracy = 90.9\%; kappa = 0.82), underpinning the potential of SVM to map complex land-use change processes such as farmland abandonment. Farmland abandonment was widespread in the study area (16.1\% of the farmland used in socialist times), likely due to decreasing profitability of agriculture after 1989. We also found substantial differences in abandonment among the countries (13.9\% in Poland, 20.7\% in Slovakia, and 13.3\% in Ukraine), and between previously collectivized farmland and farmland that remained private during socialism in Poland. These differences are likely due to differences in socialist land ownership patterns, post-socialist land reform strategies, and rural population density.},

Due to the low gradient of most coastal plain environments, the rate and aerial extent of sea-level rise (SLR) impact will rapidly accelerate once the height of the sea surface exceeds a critical elevation. Here, we develop this concept by calculating a SLR critical elevation and joint uncertainty that distinguishes between slow and rapid phases of flooding. We apply the methodology to three coastal wetlands on the Hawaiian Islands of Maui and O'ahu to exemplify the applicability of this methodology for wetlands in the Pacific island region. Using high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation models, flooded areas are mapped and ranked from high (80 \%) to low (2.5 \%) risk based upon the percent probability of flooding under the B1, A2, and A1Fl emissions scenarios. As the rate of flooding transitioned from the slow to rapid phase, the area (expressed as a percentage of the total) at a high risk of flooding under the A1Fl scenario increased from 21.0 to 53.3 \% (south Maui), 0.3 to 18.2 \% (north Maui), and 1.7 to 15.9 \% (north O'ahu). At the same time, low risk areas increased from 34.1 to 80.2, 17.7 to 46.9, and 15.4 to 46.3 \%. The critical elevation of SLR may have already passed (2003) on south Maui, and decision makers on North Maui and O'ahu may have approximately 37 years (2050) to develop, and implement adaptation strategies that meet the challenges of SLR in advance of the largest impacts.},

	abstract = {We assessed the ability of climatic, environmental, and anthropogenic variables to predict areas of high-risk for plant invasion and consider the relative importance and contribution of these predictor variables by considering two spatial scales in a region of rapidly changing climate. We created predictive distribution models, using Maxent, for three highly invasive plant species (Canada thistle, white sweetclover, and reed canarygrass) in Alaska at both a regional scale and a local scale. Regional scale models encompassed southern coastal Alaska and were developed from topographic and climatic data at a 2 km (1.2 mi) spatial resolution. Models were applied to future climate (2030). Local scale models were spatially nested within the regional area; these models incorporated physiographic and anthropogenic variables at a 30 m (98.4 ft) resolution. Regional and local models performed well (AUC values {\textgreater} 0.7), with the exception of one species at each spatial scale. Regional models predict an increase in area of suitable habitat for all species by 2030 with a general shift to higher elevation areas; however, the distribution of each species was driven by different climate and topographical variables. In contrast local models indicate that distance to right-of-ways and elevation are associated with habitat suitability for all three species at this spatial level. Combining results from regional models, capturing long-term distribution, and local models, capturing near-term establishment and distribution, offers a new and effective tool for highlighting at-risk areas and provides insight on how variables acting at different scales contribute to suitability predictions. The combinations also provides easy comparison, highlighting agreement between the two scales, where long-term distribution factors predict suitability while near-term do not and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Modelling is an effective tool to investigate the ecological state of water resources. In developing countries, the impact of sanitation infrastructures (e.g. wastewater treatment plants) is typically assessed considering the achievement of legal physicochemical quality standards, but ignoring the ecological water quality (EWQ) of the receiving river. In this paper, we developed a generic integrated ecological modelling framework quantifying the impact of wastewater discharges on the EWQ of the Cauca river (Colombia). The framework is flexible enough to be used in conjunction with different approaches/models and integrates a hydraulic and physicochemical water quality model with aquatic ecological models. Two types of ecological models were developed, habitat suitability models for selected macroinvertebrate groups and ecological assessment models based on a macroinvertebrate biotic index. Four pollution control scenarios were tested. It was found that the foreseen investments in sanitation infrastructure will lead to modest improvements of the EWQ with an increase lower than six units of the ecological index BMWP-Colombia. Advanced investments, such as the collection and treatment of all wastewater produced by the cities of Cali, Yumbo and Palmira and upgrading of the treatment systems should be considered to achieve a good EWQ. The results show that the integration of ecological models in hydraulic and physicochemical water quality models (e.g. MIKE 11) has an added value for decision support in river management and water policy. The integration of models is a key aspect for the success in environmental decision making. The main limitation of this approach is the availability of physicochemical, hydraulic and biological data that are collected simultaneously. Therefore, a change in the river monitoring strategy towards collection of data which include simultaneous measurements of these variables is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid urban growth and development, the quality of green space available is consequently been degrading. Furthermore, many land characteristics have been altered such that the whole water cycle has been significantly changed. Some of the considerable adverse effects occur by these changes include the increase of runoff which can lead to flooding and the poor quality of receiving waters. Therefore, to improve the quality of the prevailing surface conditions whilst managing the stormwater, Green Infrastructure (GI) have been introduced which is becoming one of the promising practices of restoring the natural environment across many countries around the world. The term GI in the literature is commonly referred as Low Impact Development (LID), Best Management Practices (BMP), Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUSD), Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) and Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD) in different contexts (Eliot and Trowsdale, 2006). GI in broader terms can be defined as an "interconnected network of green space that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations" (McMahon and Benedict, 2006). GI can be grouped into two main categories structural and non-structural. The former include green roofs, rainwater tanks, wetlands, bio swales, pervious pavement, stormwater detention systems, planter boxes, cisterns, rain barrels and downspout disconnection amongst others. Nonstructural GI is designing the buildings or roads to minimize the imperviousness, improvement of the infiltration ability of soils by amending the properties and improving the vegetation of specific site or region. (Eliot and Trowsdale, 2006) Though GI is best known as an alternative to conventional stormwater management strategies, it has been proven that apart from managing stormwater GI can provide a wide range of benefits known as Eco-system Services (ESS) (CNT, 2009). Such benefits include reducing Urban Heat Island (UHI), improving air quality, saving the energy, climate change and adaptation, improving habitats and community livability amongst others. Currently, different countries across the world are committing investments on promoting the benefits of having GI within their communities and therefore it is very important to have a comprehensive study on the value of the ESS they can provide. Such holistic assessment will demonstrate to stakeholders as well as the general public that the application of GIs not only a stormwater management strategy but have many social and environmental benefits. Furthermore, when these benefits can be transferred into monetary value then wider community will appreciate the importance of GI implementation in their society. ESS of GI in six main initial categories. They are water, energy, air, UHI, climate change and community liveability. The ESS of GI can be studied in terms of environmental, economic and social benefits. Since the representation of benefit of each of the ESS in monetary terms can concentrate the results in to a final common resource unit, the economic benefits of these practices can produce are used for the cumulative valuation in the framework development. The valuation is done by using formulas adopted by different researchers in previous studies and applied for the conditions in Melbourne Australia. Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia with a highest rate of urban growth. Due to this scenario the green space available within the area is alarmingly degraded by creating the importance among professionals and government bodies in developing new ways to improve the region's natural environment. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop a framework for valuing ESS of GI for Melbourne, Australia. The framework is then applied to a hypothetical case study with a green roof area of 300 square meters considering rainfall, temperature, and pricing for utilities in Melbourne area. The results of the ESS assessment indicates that a green roof located in Melbourne can approximately reduce 93 kiloliters of rainfall runoff per year and provide an economic benefit of 1245 AUD per annum by considering its energy, air quality and climate change benefits.},

The development of the proposed model was based on the Dynamically Dimensioned Search Algorithm, which can efficiently find an optimal global solution within the massive solution space inherent to multi-dimensional analysis. Therefore, the DDSLOP model can reveal landscape pattern scenarios suited to specific managerial purposes at a cellular level. To evaluate the DDSLOP model, we applied it to a landscape planning initiative that focused on the conservation of three bird species in the National Taiwan University Highland Experimental Farm (NTU-HEF). We compared the proposed model with the Land-Use Pattern Optimization-library (LUPOlib), which was used in the optimization of landscapes at a patch level. The results of the comparison revealed that our fine scale optimization method has better flexibility, and can therefore form landscape structures, which, overall, provides not only better individual habitats for the target species, but also landscape patterns that foster high habitat connectivity, both important aspects of conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {NATURA 2000 network of protected biotopes in Europe established under national and E.U. legislation. Lake ecosystems included in the network constitute sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems with vital value for the natural equilibrium and for people, as their protection and conservation is important for local and regional development. Irrational and excessive human interventions have a major impact in their two main characteristics, biodiversity and productivity. This paper describes the design and the implementation of a database for the Greek lake ecosystems that comprise the network 'NATURA 2000' within sustainable development and environmental monitoring. For the pilot version of the project, scientific registrations were used concerning the region of 'Central Macedonia' in North Greece, as the lake systems of Thessalonica prefecture as the lakes Volvi and Koronia (GR 1220001) and the former lake Lantza (GR 1220006), the lake Picrolimni (GR 1230001) and the lake Doirani (GR 1230002) of Kilkis prefecture, the artificial lake Kerkini (GR 1260008) of Serres prefecture and finally the lake Agra (GR 1240004) and the lakes Vegoritis \& Petron (GR 1340004) of Pella prefecture. Data were collected from scientific references, relative studies and recent research programs and stored in a relational database that was especially developed for that purpose. There are descriptive, qualitative and quantitative information of the lakes such as hydrological, geomorphologic information, physico-chernical characteristics of the lakes, the flora and fauna, avifauna, fish fauna, the protection legal status, land and water uses, economic activities, information on fishery production and infrastructure, human interventions and also information on the active management plan and measures for the protection, rehabilitation and sustainable development of the lake ecosystems. The total organization, storage and retrieve of information take place through a Data Base Management System (D.B.M.S.) using multiple forms to support the control of information flow inside the Database. The organized storage of all the available information within a user-friendly data management process enables the identification of social, productive, economic and biological values of the lakes from any user, computer literate or not. Thus, it can positively contribute within the evaluation of alternative scenarios in order to support planning and development projects and decision-making purposes. The suggested application constitutes an effective tool in a pilot version for the design of the total lake management that will be based on local characteristics and aims in their sustainable exploitation.},

	abstract = {After fossil fuel burning, clearing of forests for agriculture is the second most significant factor increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Replanting trees on previously cleared land around the world could reduce the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, forests were usually cleared to grow crops or graze animals, so there is no possibility of completely restoring forests on most cleared lands. There is a need to develop agroforestry systems, which integrate trees with agricultural activities.
One of the key problems in developing successful agroforestry systems is identifying which trees can be successfully grown in different areas. This problem will become even greater as tree breeding produces a wider variety of genotypes available for planting. General methods are described to identify where a particular tree (species, provenance or clone) with potential for use in agroforestry systems can be grown. The methods also help to identify locations where particular trees are growing under relatively extreme climatic conditions for that taxa. Conditions at these locations should be carefully evaluated as more reliable future climatic scenarios are developed. In the meantime they could be monitored to provide early warning of the effects of climatic and atmospheric change.},

	abstract = {Brazilian agriculture covers about one-third of the land area and is expected to expand further. We assessed the compliance of present Brazilian agriculture with environmental legislation and identified challenges for agricultural development connected to this legislation. We found (i) minor illegal land use in protected areas under public administration, (ii) a large deficit in legal reserves and protected riparian zones on private farmland, and (iii) large areas of unprotected natural vegetation in regions experiencing agriculture expansion. Achieving full compliance with the environmental laws as they presently stand would require drastic changes in agricultural land use, where large agricultural areas are taken out of production and converted back to natural vegetation. The outcome of a full compliance with environmental legislation might not be satisfactory due to leakage, where pristine unprotected areas become converted to compensate for lost production as current agricultural areas are reconverted to protected natural vegetation. Realizing the desired protection of biodiversity and natural vegetation, while expanding agriculture to meet food and biofuel demand, may require a new approach to environmental protection. New legal and regulatory instruments and the establishment of alternative development models should be considered.},

However, in terms of national policies, Brazil is consistently making decisions that go against the global policies it ratifies. For instance, Brazilian governors have recently revised the Brazilian Forest Act - its main environmental legislation on private land, reduced the area covered by some protected areas and allowed the creation of new hydropower plants on undisturbed Amazonian rivers, and have plans to open indigenous reserves to mining. Among other consequences, these controversial actions made by national leaders may increase CO2 emissions and propel a massive loss of species, with irreversible consequences to the provision of ecosystem services and goods. In this paper, I present inconsistent actions made by policy and decision makers in Brazil and argue for a more focused environmental decision in Brazil, which matches the country's international position as a leader and that could help Brazil to achieve the status of a biodiversity superpower.},

In order to support legal rulings, decisions by public officers, and to inform other stakeholders, we present a balanced assessment of the positive and negative consequences of Native Vegetation Protection Law in light of current scientific knowledge. Key advances were noted in the systems of controls and incentives, which promoted new mechanisms and policies to support the implementation of this law. The main environmental setbacks were (i) the removal of protection of certain environmentally fragile areas, (ii) the concession of amnesty of fines incurred for violating the preceding legislation, (iii) allowing continuous farming or maintenance of infrastructure in areas protected by law, without full recovery of native vegetation. The weakening of Native Vegetation Protection Law may hamper soil and watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and even agricultural productivity, without manifest benefits for the country. On that account, we recommend that: (i) judiciary rulings and state and county regulations to correct pending issues with the Native Vegetation Protection Law based on scientific knowledge and with wider citizen participation; (ii) the strengthening of agencies for rural technical assistance; (iii) the development of incentives to develop the supply chain for native vegetation recovery; (iv) the regulation of compensation for Legal Reserves based on clear and robust environmental criteria; and (v) the assessment of legal compliance has also to be based on the environmental quality of recovered areas.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of tropical forest fragmentation on carbon balance, most of our knowledge comes from few sites in the Amazon and disregard long-term underlying processes related to landscape configuration. Accurate estimation of fragmentation effects should account for additive edge effects and edge age. Here we investigated those effects on C stock and forest structure (density, height, basal area) in fragments (13 to 362ha) of forest with≥70years old, surrounded by pasture, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest region. We measured 5297 stems sampled in four categories replicated in eight fragments: fragment interiors ({\textgreater}110m from edges); old ({\textgreater}50years) corner edges ({\textless} 50m); old straight edges; and new (ca. 44years) straight edges. Aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and diameter at breast height, and converted to carbon. Carbon stock was highly variable between categories, scoring from 10.44Mgha−1 up to 107.59Mgha−1 (average of 41.27±23Mgha−1). Contrary to our expectations, interior plots did not have higher carbon stock, basal area or tree stem density than edges, but only taller trees. We found no significant effects of edge age or additive edge effects on carbon stocks. These results suggest that edge effects in the Atlantic rainforest may differ from those observed in more recently fragmented tropical forests, such as the Amazonian forest. We hypothesize that in heavily human-modified landscapes, more extensive edge effects combined with other human disturbances on tree mortality and carbon stock may contribute to overall high levels of degradation, reducing differences between edge and interior habitats. Existing models based on Amazonian forest data may underestimate the true impacts of fragmentation on carbon storage in landscapes with an old history of human disturbance.},

From a conservation standpoint, certification of tropical agroforestry crops, especially coffee and cocoa, is of particular interest given the potentially high biodiversity value of agroforestry systems and the substantial market penetration of coffee and cocoa certification in recent years. Here, we review experience with coffee and cocoa certification, summarize evidence on conservation impacts, and explore future needs. While there is much evidence that environmental criteria behind certification support biodiversity conservation, it is less clear to what extent certification is the cause of improved conservation outcomes. Additionally, the farm-scale focus of current certification models may limit delivery of biodiversity conservation benefits, as maintenance of biodiversity depends on processes at larger landscape scales. To address this scale mismatch, we suggest that investment and innovation in certification over the next decade prioritize landscape conservation outcomes. This may be achieved by (1) linking existing certification mechanisms with broader landscape and ecosystem service management approaches and/or (2) expanding current certification models to consider the landscape itself as the certified unit.},

	abstract = {Sustainability standards and certification serve to differentiate and provide market recognition to goods produced in accordance with social and environmental good practices, typically including practices to protect biodiversity. Such standards have seen rapid growth, including in tropical agricultural commodities such as cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soybeans, and tea. Given the role of sustainability standards in influencing land use in hotspots of biodiversity, deforestation, and agricultural intensification, much could be gained from efforts to evaluate and increase the conservation payoff of these schemes. To this end, we devised a systematic approach for monitoring and evaluating the conservation impacts of agricultural sustainability standards and for using the resulting evidence to improve the effectiveness of such standards over time. The approach is oriented around a set of hypotheses and corresponding research questions about how sustainability standards are predicted to deliver conservation benefits. These questions are addressed through data from multiple sources, including basic common information from certification audits; field monitoring of environmental outcomes at a sample of certified sites; and rigorous impact assessment research based on experimental or quasi-experimental methods. Integration of these sources can generate time-series data that are comparable across sites and regions and provide detailed portraits of the effects of sustainability standards. To implement this approach, we propose new collaborations between the conservation research community and the sustainability standards community to develop common indicators and monitoring protocols, foster data sharing and synthesis, and link research and practice more effectively. As the role of sustainability standards in tropical land-use governance continues to evolve, robust evidence on the factors contributing to effectiveness can help to ensure that such standards are designed and implemented to maximize benefits for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Socio-environmental certification uses evaluation criteria to promote the conservation of the natural environment and landscape connectivity, with the aim of constructing agricultural landscapes more suitable for biodiversity conservation. To test this, we examine whether socio-environmental certification of Brazilian coffee farms contributes to local conservation, particularly in terms of deforestation control, habitat protection and regeneration, and connectivity. The analysis compared changes in landscape structure and connectivity in certified farms before (1995–2002) and after nine years from the beginning of the certification process (2002–2011), using as a reference the surrounding landscape and a control group of non-certified farms. To quantify changes in landscape connectivity we used probabilistic indices of functional connectivity based on graph theory, and two species of terrestrial mammals with contrasting dispersal capacities and habitat requirements: Priodontes maximus (giant armadillo) and Marmosops incanus (gray slender mouse opossum). Our results show that changes in the last decade have been subtle, but that certified farms differ from surrounding areas for the greater deforestation control and habitat availability for both land cover types, and for the greater connectivity for P. maximus. The difference between certified and non-certified farms is not clear-cut, however, we have evidence that the certified farms contributed more than the surrounding areas to the conservation of the studied species when the balance of gains and losses of connectivity is considered. The subtle differences in temporal changes and groups might be partially explained by the fact that certified farms already had a different conservation profile at the beginning of the certification process. Despite the limitations in the sampling size (small number) and time scale (only nine years after certification) which may hinders the detection of certification effects, our findings indicate that certification was important in controlling deforestation and the conversion of new natural areas to agricultural lands.},

We identified more than 200 bird species that provide pest control services across both temperate and tropical regions. While most avian predators are habitat-generalist species, a substantial fraction of pest control services in tropical regions was mediated by habitat-dependent species, suggesting a link between conservation management and maintenance of pest control services. We identified a three-part research agenda for future investigations of the relationships between landscape structure and avian-mediated pest control, focusing on an improved understanding of mechanisms related to: (1) predator–prey interactions and landscape modulation of trophic relationships, (2) bird dispersal ability and landscape connectivity, and (3) cross-habitat spillover of habitat-dependent avian predators.Implications These findings can be applied to efforts to manage and design landscapes capable of supporting both biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Brazil’s new Forest Code has the potential to halt illegal deforestation in the country’s native forests and savannas through implementation of a federal land registry—along with powerful tools that facilitate enforcement and give landowners a pathway to restoring or compensating their “forest deficits.” This study suggests that these tools fall short of their promise. Although landowners in eastern Amazonia have been motivated to join state land registries, many continue to deforest and few have restored their illegally cleared areas. Results indicate that the economic benefits of full compliance with the Forest Code remain scant. To end deforestation, Brazil must realign its financial and policy incentives to encourage this outcome. The fate of the country’s forests hangs in the balance., The 2012 Brazilian Forest Code governs the fate of forests and savannas on Brazil’s 394 Mha of privately owned lands. The government claims that a new national land registry (SICAR), introduced under the revised law, could end illegal deforestation by greatly reducing the cost of monitoring, enforcement, and compliance. This study evaluates that potential, using data from state-level land registries (CAR) in Pará and Mato Grosso that were precursors of SICAR. Using geospatial analyses and stakeholder interviews, we quantify the impact of CAR on deforestation and forest restoration, investigating how landowners adjust their behaviors over time. Our results indicate rapid adoption of CAR, with registered properties covering a total of 57 Mha by 2013. This suggests that the financial incentives to join CAR currently exceed the costs. Registered properties initially showed lower deforestation rates than unregistered ones, but these differences varied by property size and diminished over time. Moreover, only 6\% of registered producers reported taking steps to restore illegally cleared areas on their properties. Our results suggest that, from the landowner's perspective, full compliance with the Forest Code offers few economic benefits. Achieving zero illegal deforestation in this context would require the private sector to include full compliance as a market criterion, while state and federal governments develop SICAR as a de facto enforcement mechanism. These results are relevant to other tropical countries and underscore the importance of developing a policy mix that creates lasting incentives for sustainable land-use practices.},

Abstract
Sustainable agricultural landscapes by definition provide high magnitude and stability of ecosystem services, biodiversity and crop productivity. However, few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi-natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower-visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flower-visitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1 km from adjacent natural areas, spatial stability decreased by 25, 16 and 9\% for richness, visitation and fruit set, respectively, while temporal stability decreased by 39\% for richness and 13\% for visitation. Mean richness, visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation, by 34, 27 and 16\% at 1 km respectively. In contrast, honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented {\textgreater} 25\% of crop visits in 21 studies. Therefore, wild pollinators are relevant for crop productivity and stability even when honey bees are abundant. Policies to preserve and restore natural areas in agricultural landscapes should enhance levels and reliability of pollination services.},

Across six European regions and 2 years, we assessed how landscape-scale cover of MFCs affected pollinator densities in 408 MFC fields and adjacent SNHs. In MFC fields, densities of bumblebees, solitary bees, managed honeybees and hoverflies were negatively related to the cover of MFCs in the landscape. In SNHs, densities of bumblebees declined with increasing cover of MFCs but densities of honeybees increased. The densities of all pollinators were generally unrelated to the cover of SNHs in the landscape. Although MFC fields apparently attracted pollinators from SNHs, in landscapes with large areas of MFCs they became diluted. The resulting lower densities might negatively affect yields of pollinator-dependent crops and the reproductive success of wild plants. An expansion of MFCs needs to be accompanied by pollinator-supporting practices in agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {* 1Experimental manipulations have shown positive impacts of increased species richness on ecosystem productivity, but there remain some questions about this relationship. First, most studies last {\textless} 4 years, which raises issues about whether diversity–productivity relationships are maintained in mature communities. Secondly, the conservation relevance of many studies is debatable. We addressed both issues using long-term experimental studies of the agriculturally relevant hay yield of recreated species-rich grasslands.
* 2Grasslands were recreated within replicated experiments in ex-arable fields at two sites in southern England by using either species-poor or species-rich seed mixtures. The species-poor mixture comprised seven grasses as recommended for grassland creation in English agri-environment schemes. The species-rich mixture comprised 11 grasses and 28 forbs and was designed to recreate a typical southern English hay meadow.
* 3After 8 years the plots sown with species-rich mixtures resembled target diverse community types. The plots sown with species-poor mixtures had been colonized by a number of forbs but had lower numbers of grasses, legumes and other forbs than the species-rich plots. Increased hay yield of the species-rich plots in the first years of the experiments have been described in an earlier paper, and these differences were maintained after 8 years.
* 4In the eighth year the species-rich plots had an average 43\% higher hay yield than the species-poor plots. Regression analysis showed that the variation in hay yield was related to differences in the number of non-leguminous forbs and showed no relation to grass or legume numbers. This suggests increased hay yield is an effect of the greater range of life forms exhibited by forbs rather than a simple fertilizing effect of legumes.
* 5The nitrogen content and phosphorus content of the hay showed complex treatment effects over time. However, the nutritional value of the hay was above the minimum requirements for livestock.
* 6Synthesis and applications. The aims of conservationists and farmers can often be in conflict. This study has shown that the recreation of diverse grasslands of conservation value can have a positive impact on hay yield, which benefits the farm business, and this is repeated across differing sites. Because the effect is maintained over time, farm income will be increased in the long term.},

	abstract = {The recent intensification of agriculture, and the prospects of future intensification, will have major detrimental impacts on the nonagricultural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the world. The doubling of agricultural food production during the past 35 years was associated with a 6.87-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization, a 3.48-fold increase in phosphorus fertilization, a 1.68-fold increase in the amount of irrigated cropland, and a 1.1-fold increase in land in cultivation. Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18\% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {Agriculture and urban activities are major sources of phosphorus and nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by overenrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophication can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent, and recovery is slow.},

Here we identify the world's terrestrial biomes and, at a finer spatial scale, ecoregions in which biodiversity and ecological function are at greatest risk because of extensive habitat conversion and limited habitat protection. Habitat conversion exceeds habitat protection by a ratio of 8 : 1 in temperate grasslands and Mediterranean biomes, and 10 : 1 in more than 140 ecoregions. These regions include some of the most biologically distinctive, species rich ecosystems on Earth, as well as the last home of many threatened and endangered species. Confronting the biome crisis requires a concerted and comprehensive response aimed at protecting not only species, but the variety of landscapes, ecological interactions, and evolutionary pressures that sustain biodiversity, generate ecosystem services, and evolve new species in the future.},

	abstract = {Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.},

The Society for Ecological Restoration International has produced generic guidelines for conceiving, organizing, conducting and assessing ecological restoration projects. Additionally, there are now good conceptual frameworks, guidelines and practical methods for developing ecological restoration programmes that are based on sound ecological principles and supported by empirical evidence and modelling approaches. Restoration methods must also be technically achievable and socially acceptable and spread over a range of locations. It is important to reconcile differences between methods that favour conservation and those that favour economic returns, to ensure that conservation efforts are beneficial for both landowners and biodiversity. One option for this type of mutual benefit is the use of agri-environmental schemes to provide financial incentives to landholders in exchange for providing conservation services and other benefits. However, further work is required to define and measure the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The broader potential for ecological restoration to improve the sustainability of agricultural production while conserving biodiversity in farmscapes and reducing external costs is high, but there is still much to learn, particularly for the most efficient use of agri-environmental schemes to change land use practice.},

While many descriptive studies have documented the experience of farming communities using agroecological approaches, evidence on social and economic indicators of agroecology is poorly documented in a quantitative sense. The present study aims to build a framework and provide a quantitative overview of the effects of adopting selected agroecological practices at the farm level. A literature review has been conducted in order to identify scientific work addressing the contribution of agroecology to a set of socio-economic indicators, which affect human, financial and social assets. Data extracted from 17 peer-reviewed papers were analysed using two techniques: vote counting and general linear mixed-effects models on effect sizes. We found preliminary evidence of agroecology’s positive contribution to improving financial capital. However, data extracted does not provide meaningful information on other capital endowments (human and social). This is mainly due to the fact that there is a lack of data concerning the socio-economic impact of agroecology. In addition, qualitative methods (e.g. Q-methodology) should be integrated into further research in order to capture farmer perspectives.},

Both of these have been very highly cited and kicked off an explosion of research, policy, and applications of the idea, including the establishment of this journal. This article traces the history leading up to these publications and the subsequent debates, research, institutions, policies, on-the-ground actions, and controversies they triggered. It also explores what we have learned during this period about the key issues: from definitions to classification to valuation, from integrated modelling to public participation and communication, and the evolution of institutions and governance innovation. Finally, it provides recommendations for the future. In particular, it points to the weakness of the mainstream economic approaches to valuation, growth, and development. It concludes that the substantial contributions of ecosystem services to the sustainable wellbeing of humans and the rest of nature should be at the core of the fundamental change needed in economic theory and practice if we are to achieve a societal transformation to a sustainable and desirable future.},

Despite the large and growing quantity of published ecosystem services research, there remains a substantial gap between this research and the information required to support decisions. Research often provides models and tools that do not fully link social and ecological systems; are too complex, specialized, and costly to use; and are targeted to outcomes that differ from those needed by decision makers. Decision makers require cost-effective, straightforward, transferable, scalable, meaningful, and defensible methods that can be readily understood. We provide illustrative examples of these gaps between research and practice and describe how researchers can make their work relevant to decision makers by using Benefit Relevant Indicators (BRIs) and choosing models appropriate for particular decision contexts. We use examples primarily from the United States, including cases that illustrate varying degrees of success in closing these gaps. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities researchers face in adapting their work to meet the needs of practitioners.},

Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives.},

	abstract = {Although now over 100 years old, the classiﬁcation of climate originally formulated by Wladimir Ko¨ppen and modiﬁed by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Ko¨ppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Ko¨ppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a twodimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1◦×0.1◦ grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classiﬁed into one climate type by the Ko¨ppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah). The updated world Ko¨ppen-Geiger climate map is freely available electronically in the Supplementary Material Section (http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/ 11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007-supplement.zip).},

We concluded that certification went beyond the pilot scale and reached a national extent, present in various biomes and regions. Certification has been implemented for over a decade in a variety of agricultural and forestry production business of varying sizes engaged in highly competitive value chains. Certification has contributed to changes towards a reduction of deforestation, a promotion of vegetation restoration, an increased connectivity of native vegetation and a provision of habitat for biodiversity. As a result, certified operations protect greater areas of native vegetation than their surrounding regions and showed higher compliance with the Forest Code. The main role of certification and voluntary market instruments is to innovate and demonstrate solutions towards sustainability challenges in scale. However, responding to the major challenge of conservation requires coordinating among innovative incentives and instruments with public policies.},

We assessed all coffee producers certified under the Sustainable Agriculture Network–Rainforest Alliance Certified system in Brazil in 2011, comprising 55 individual farms and 11 groups of individual producers. We found that group certification has increased access to small and medium size producers compared to certification for individually certified producers. There is diversity in the way producers are organized and in the profile of producers among and inside groups. However, the small producers participating in group certification are those with high productivity, suggesting that the most marginalized producers are still unable to access the certification system. Thus additional policy interventions will be necessary to promote more sustainable practices among the large numbers of marginalized coffee farmers in Brazil.},

Yet there is no comprehensive framework for defining and assessing “equity”, nor is there a methodology for determining differences in definitions among forest stakeholders. We've employed an analytical framework to a case study of the FSC in Brazil to assess if FSC equity goals are coherent and adherent to its policies, standards and impacts, what factors in FSC's implementation are influencing that coherency, and whether FSC's policies on equity match expectations of stakeholders affected by certification. We found that contextual market factors, local capacity, and procedural rules governing the certification process influence FSC's implementation in an asymmetric way, favoring the certification of large industrial firms over community-based operations. Meanwhile FSC policies and standards prioritize procedural and contextual equity within the operations of individual certified firms. This contrasts with the expectations of local stakeholders focused on distributive outcomes. In general, FSC's ability to reach both its own and local stakeholder goals for equity relies on the proactive agency of actors committed to overcoming the many barriers to local benefit that are both external and internal to certification itself.},

Todas as fazendas participam do programa Educampo. O período principal de análise foi o biênio produtivo 2011/13, mas também foi utilizado informações do primeiro biênio de cada propriedade no programa Educampo. Os resultados revelaram a não existência de ágios sobre os preços, ou seja, o produto certificado não tem um sobrepreço. Também não foi identificado diferença de custo por unidade de área, indicando que a certificação não aumenta de forma significativa o custo de produção. Contudo, a produtividade é significativamente maior nas fazendas certificadas, afetando a renda bruta que também é maior nesse grupo. Consequentemente, os indicares de eficiência econômica são significativamente maiores no grupo certificado. Há indícios que os grupos apresentam diferença a priori, no entanto, essas se acentuam ao longo da participação no programa Educampo e com a adoção da certificação.

Consumers increasingly act on preferences for a more just and sustainable world by purchasing certified agricultural products. Using survey data from coffee growers in Mexico and Peru, we explore the economic sustainability of certified coffee, looking at conventional, Fair Trade/organic, and Rainforest Alliance certified growers. The analysis reveals that yields rather than price premiums are most important for increasing net cash returns for coffee growing households. Given the link between net returns and producer participation in certified coffee schemes, the findings suggest that certification norms that permit improving yields are essential for improving grower welfare and attracting and maintaining growers.},

	abstract = {Human activities are causing Earth’s sixth major extinction event1—an accelerating decline of the world’s stocks of biological diversity at rates 100 to 1,000 times pre-human levels2. Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space3. However, in today’s increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed4,5, the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30\% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate better regulation, sustainable supply-chain certification and consumer product labelling.},

	abstract = {Firms and governments are increasingly turning to voluntary programs such as eco-certification and eco-labeling as core instruments for managing forests. To probe the prospects and limits of this shift toward eco-consumerism as a mechanism for global change, this article analyzes its value for improving forest management globally. It reveals that eco-consumerism is improving some aspects; yet, for both supply and demand-side reasons, the advances are incremental and unequal and overall doing little to slow deforestation. The article therefore highlights the danger of overestimating the potential of voluntary eco-certification and advances a set of policy and management solutions to enhance the effectiveness of eco-consumer initiatives such as forest certification. Solutions include  internal incremental adjustments to certification programs, coordinated alongside more fundamental external systemic changes in the marketing, industrial use, and valuation of the world’s forests.},

For the agri-food sector, multiple instruments have been developed to green supply chains. Yet little is known about the underlying process and conditions under which green sourcing concerns lead to the adoption of specific sustainability instruments among agri-food companies. This study: i) offers a synthesis of the most commonly used instruments agri-food companies adopt to promote sustainability in their supply chains; ii) proposes an analytical framework to elucidate how those decisions are made, based on the competitive environment in which firms operate—with respect to location of their raw materials, technologies available to their suppliers, leverage over upstream suppliers, and end-markets’ characteristics; and iii) presents seven case-studies illustrating the decision-making process leading to the adoption of a specific instrument by a particular company. Companies that do not have sustainable technologies available to improve their environmental practices but operate in highly sensitive places are better off taking their operation somewhere else. But companies with available cleaner technologies, effective law enforcement and control over the supply chains, as well as a brand to protect, can capitalize on their environmental efforts by introducing strict standards, such as third-party certifications. Enforcement of social and environmental regulations at countries of origin is a key factor that deters companies form adopting very strict standards, even if they have a brand value to enhance. The multiplication of private labels and initiatives are, in most cases, not driven by a desire to disorient the consumer, but rather by a careful consideration of the complex conditions under which agri-food supply chains operate. With minor adaptations, the framework could be applied to other economic sectors that have environmental impacts, from mining and energy-generating industries, to apparel, and electronics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Over half of the European landscape is under agricultural management and has been for millennia. Many species and ecosystems of conservation concern in Europe depend on agricultural management and are showing ongoing declines. Agri?environment schemes (AES) are designed partly to address this. They are a major source of nature conservation funding within the European Union (EU) and the highest conservation expenditure in Europe. We reviewed the structure of current AES across Europe. Since a 2003 review questioned the overall effectiveness of AES for biodiversity, there has been a plethora of case studies and meta?analyses examining their effectiveness. Most syntheses demonstrate general increases in farmland biodiversity in response to AES, with the size of the effect depending on the structure and management of the surrounding landscape. This is important in the light of successive EU enlargement and ongoing reforms of AES. We examined the change in effect size over time by merging the data sets of 3 recent meta?analyses and found that schemes implemented after revision of the EU's agri?environmental programs in 2007 were not more effective than schemes implemented before revision. Furthermore, schemes aimed at areas out of production (such as field margins and hedgerows) are more effective at enhancing species richness than those aimed at productive areas (such as arable crops or grasslands). Outstanding research questions include whether AES enhance ecosystem services, whether they are more effective in agriculturally marginal areas than in intensively farmed areas, whether they are more or less cost?effective for farmland biodiversity than protected areas, and how much their effectiveness is influenced by farmer training and advice? The general lesson from the European experience is that AES can be effective for conserving wildlife on farmland, but they are expensive and need to be carefully designed and targeted.},

The package includes a stochastic ordered allocation procedure as well as an implementation of the CLUE-S algorithm. We demonstrate its functionality by simulating land use change at the Plum Island Ecosystems site, using a data set included with the package.

	abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems provide many ecosystem services (ES) which are essential to human health and well-being. In turn, some ES affect agricultural productivity. Managing agricultural lands to provide more ES and higher quality ES may be essential for the long-term sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Most agricultural lands, however, are managed for the short-term production of food, ﬁber, and fuel, often at the expense of other ES. Proposed solutions to the underprovision of ES often involve government regulation or market incentives. A growing number of scholars, however, recognize the potential for a third approach —cooperative solutions. One important element in determining if an ES is a suitable candidate for cooperative solutions is its resource characteristics. Accordingly, this paper: 1.) provides a framework for determining an ES's suitability for collective management based on its resource characteristics, 2.) provides an in-depth analysis of three agricultural-based ES to show how the framework differentiates between ES and 3.) uses the framework to analyze fourteen agricultural-based ES for their suitability for collective management. Ten out of the fourteen ES analyzed may be well suited (e.g. pollination), suited (e.g. ﬂood control), or moderately suited (e.g. nature recreation) for collective management under current incentive systems in agricultural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Designing landscapes that can meet human needs, while maintaining functioning ecosystems, is essential for long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.},

	title = {The rewards of investing in sustainable land management},
	url = {https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/15701},
	abstract = {Executive summary 
  
In the face of global land degradation and its impacts on humanity and the environment, the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative is dedicated to raising global awareness of the full economic potential of land and land services including market and non-market values (e.g. carbon sequestration, recreational values, nutrient cycling, etc.) and the costs of land degradation. The ELD Initiative is focused on creating efficient and practical tools and methodologies to fully assess lands value and thus encourage sustainable land management. 
  
Valuing land and related ecosystem services is an urgent and necessary action in order to focus attention on land degradation as a serious global problem. Land’s economic value is chronically undervalued and commonly determined by immediate agricultural or forestry market values. This focus on short-term gain motivates the highest extraction rates possible from land, leading to unsustainable land management and degradation (the reduction or loss in biological or economic productivity). Between 10 – 20 \% of drylands are degraded and 24 \% of globally usable land on Earth is degraded at an estimated economic loss of USD 40 billion per year. This particularly affects the rural poor – those who depend directly upon the land for sustenance and income, and number over 1.2 billion. 
  
There are clear economic and environmental actions that can prevent and/or reverse land degradation. Further, the adoption of sustainable land management could deliver up to USD 1.4 trillion in increased crop production. Given the combined global trends of increasing population and decreasing land availability and quality, there is great incentive to increase productivity on parcels of land already in use and promote sustainable land management. 
  
The costs of taking action to prevent and/or reverse land degradation are usually less than the benefits that can be obtained for investing in and applying sustainable land management practices. The case studies reveal that even with an incomplete assessment of the total value of ecosystem services investments in land prove to be beneficial to society and the environment. 
  
Several existing options and pathways for action to address land degradation are available for successful change. These options range from adapting to biophysical conditions, to changing livelihood strategies. Examples include: reforestation, afforestation, the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices, and the establishment of alternative livelihoods such as eco-tourism. Economic instruments to reverse land degradation trends include: payments for ecosystem services, subsidies, taxes, voluntary payments for environmental conservation, and access to micro-finance and credit. In addition, facilitating change requires adaptations to legal, social, and policy-focused contexts that favour sustainable land management. 
  
The ELD Initiative will inform the private sector of the opportunities available for investment and will help close the gap between better land stewardship and business practices. The companies likely to be the most interested in efforts to prevent and/or reverse land degradation will be those that have more direct contact with land and thus be the most sensitive to land degradation. They will be found in resource-dependent sectors, such as the food and beverage, leisure and travel, and basic resource sectors. 
  
The ELD Initiative will provide total economic valuation methods that will aid decision-making in land investments and land use planning, especially under the various conditions of any country affected by land degradation. Three main outcomes of the ELD Initiative include: (i) a vigorous case study analysis of existing literature and research to analyse the global research status of ELD, separated into three working groups of: Data and Methodology, Scenarios, and Options and Pathways to action, (ii) the funding of further research that addresses identified gaps in knowledge, technology, policy, and community motivation, and (iii) the development of a series of reports summarizing final conclusions and guidelines, individually targeted at policy makers, scientific communities, the private sector and local administrators and practitioners. Outputs of the initiative will inform the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and its proposal for a new Sustainable Development Goal for post-Rio+20 of zero net land degradation (defined as the achievement of a state of land degradation neutrality). 
  
African, Asian, and Central and South American countries need to build their capacity in assessing the value of land. Current case studies indicate that much of the work done on economic valuation in these areas has been done by the international scientific community without adequate involvement or capacity building within the studied countries. The ELD Initiative will incorporate capacity building activities into its projects to ensure that qualified personnel are available and present in affected countries. 
  
The ELD Initiative is uniquely posited to address economic issues surrounding degraded lands, as a collaborative, international collection of researchers and citizens committed to delivering comprehensible, transboundary, scientific, political, and technological guidelines rooted in peer-reviewed research and designed for on-the-ground, customizable applications. This interim report is a reflection of work that has been performed, synthesized, and analysed, hitherto, building on earlier studies and ELD contributions to the conclusions and recommendations of the UNCCD Second Scientific Conference.},

	abstract = {Thirty-five percent of global production from crops including at least 800 cultivated plants depend on animal pollination. The transformation of agriculture in the past half-century has triggered a decline in bees and other insect pollinators. In North America, losses of bee colonies have accelerated since 2004, leaving the continent with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the past 50 years. A number of factors linked to industrial modes of agriculture affect bee colonies and other pollinators around the world, ranging from habitat degradation due to monocultures with consequent declines in flowering plants and the use of damaging insecticides. Incentives should be offered to farmers to restore pollinator-friendly habitats, including flower provisioning within or around crop fields and elimination of use of insecticides by adopting agroecological production methods. Conventional farmers should be extremely cautious in the choice, timing, and application of insecticides and other chemicals. Here, we review the literature providing mounting evidence that the restoration of plant biodiversity within and around crop fields can improve habitat for domestic and wild bees as well as other insects and thus enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Main findings are the following: (1) certain weed species within crop fields that provide food resources and refuge should be maintained at tolerable levels within crop fields to aid in the survival of viable populations of pollinators. (2) Careful manipulation strategies need to be defined in order to avoid weed competition with crops and interference with certain cultural practices. Economic thresholds of weed populations, as well as factors affecting crop–weed balance within a crop season, need to be defined for specific cropping systems. (3) More research is warranted to advance knowledge on identifying beneficial weed species and ways to sponsor them to attract pollinators while not reducing yields through interference. (4) In areas of intensive farming, field margins, field edges and paths, headlands, fence-lines, rights of way, and nearby uncultivated patches of land are important refuges for many pollinators. (5) Maintenance and restoration of hedgerows and other vegetation features at field borders is therefore essential for harboring pollinators. (6) Appropriate management of non-cropped areas to encourage wild pollinators may prove to be a cost-effective means of maximizing crop yield.},

Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high?quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high?quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome.

Participatory monitoring could play a crucial role in providing accountability, generating local buy in, and catalyzing learning in monitoring systems that need scalability and adaptability to a range of local sites. We synthesized current knowledge from literature searches and interviews to provide lessons for the development of a scalable, multisite participatory monitoring system. Studies show that local people can collect accurate data on forest change, drivers of change, threats to reforestation, and biophysical and socioeconomic impacts that remote sensing cannot. They can do this at one-third the cost of professionals. Successful participatory monitoring systems collect information on a few simple indicators, respond to local priorities, provide appropriate incentives for participation, catalyze learning and decision making based on frequent analyses and multilevel interactions with other stakeholders. Participatory monitoring could provide a framework for linking global, national, and local needs, aspirations, and capacities for forest restoration.

	abstract = {Abstract Restoring natural capital is essential for biodiversity and ecosystem services that support human well?being. Although ecological pathways for restoration are a major area of study, little is known about the economic pathways to which these efforts must be linked. This linkage, however, is important for maximizing return?on?investment (ROI) from restoration projects. We developed a general ROI framework to guide investments in restoration. We applied this framework to reforestation of montane pastureland in Hawaii, focusing on two specific conservation targets: native forest birds and understory plants. We found that restoring partial tree cover on pastureland is most attractive for birds, while understory plants require investment in full forest restoration. Nonlinearities in restoration pathways present in Hawaii, and likely elsewhere, generate these substantially different ROI profiles across potential projects. This information can guide the design of policies supporting cost?effective practices to help ensure that limited resources achieve the greatest impact.},

We summarize the state of the art of ecosystem services–based management and the information needs for applying it. Three case studies of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites—coastal, urban, and agricultural—illustrate the usefulness, information needs, quantification possibilities, and methods for this approach. One example of the application of this approach, with rigorously established service changes and valuations taken from the literature, is used to illustrate the potential for full economic valuation of several agricultural landscape management options, including managing for water quality, biodiversity, and crop productivity.},

Applied research on highly productive ecosystems, including agroecosystems, will dominate ecology. Ecology may become less collegial and more competitive. Biodiversity preservation will be closely tied to preservation of productive ecosystems and provision of high ecosystem services. Restoration and management of rich natural ecosystems will be as important as protection of existing wild areas. Energy-intensive micromanagement of ecosystems will become less feasible.

They include habitat conversion, environmental toxification, climate change, and direct exploitation of wildlife, among others. Moreover, the projected addition of 2.6 billion people by mid-century will almost certainly have a greater environmental impact than that of the last 2.6 billion. Collectively, these trends portend a grim future for biodiversity under a business-as-usual scenario. These threats and their interactions are formidable, but we review seven strategies that, if implemented soundly and scaled up dramatically, would preserve a substantial portion of global biodiversity. These are actions to stabilize the human population and reduce its material consumption, the deployment of endowment funds and other strategies to ensure the efficacy and permanence of conservation areas, steps to make human-dominated landscapes hospitable to biodiversity, measures to account for the economic costs of habitat degradation, the ecological reclamation of degraded lands and repatriation of extirpated species, the education and empowerment of people in the rural tropics, and the fundamental transformation of human attitudes about nature. Like the carbon “stabilization wedges” outlined by Pacala and Socolow [Pacala S, Socolow R (2004) Stabilization wedges: Solving the climate problem for the next 50 years with current technologies. Science 305:968–972] (1), the science and technologies needed to effect this vision already exist. The remaining challenges are largely social, political, and economic. Although academic conservation biology still has an important role to play in developing technical tools and knowledge, success at this juncture hinges more on a massive mobilization of effort to do things that have traditionally been outside the scope of the discipline.},

The CBD target “to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss” was incorporated into the MDGs in 2002. Our lack of progress toward the 2010 target (3, 4) could undermine achievement of the MDGs and poverty reduction in the long term. With increasing global challenges, such as population growth, climate change, and overconsumption of ecosystem services, we need further integration of the poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation agendas.

There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these ?ecosystem services? into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder?defined scenarios of land?use/land?cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner, and analyzing tradeoffs between them, can help to make natural resource decisions more effective, efficient, and defensible.},

The concept of ecosystem services has been developed to address this link between ecosystems and human welfare. Since policy decisions are often evaluated through cost?benefit assessments, an economic analysis can help make ecosystem service research operational. In this paper we provide some simple economic analyses to discuss key concepts involved in formalizing ecosystem service research. These include the distinction between services and benefits, understanding the importance of marginal ecosystem changes, formalizing the idea of a safe minimum standard for ecosystem service provision, and discussing how to capture the public benefits of ecosystem services. We discuss how the integration of economic concepts and ecosystem services can provide policy and decision makers with a fuller spectrum of information for making conservation?conversion trade?offs. We include the results from a survey of the literature and a questionnaire of researchers regarding how ecosystem service research can be integrated into the policy process. We feel this discussion of economic concepts will be a practical aid for ecosystem service research to become more immediately policy relevant.},

The overall development goal of sustainable human well-being should be to obtain social, ecologic, and economic viability, not merely growth of the market economy. Therefore new and more integrated methods to value sustainable development are needed. There is a huge amount of data and methods currently available to model and analyze land management practices. However, it is scattered and requires consolidation and reformatting to be useful. In this review we collected and evaluated databases and computer models that could be useful for analyzing and valuing land management options for sustaining natural capital and maximizing ecosystem services. The current methods and models are not well equipped to handle large scale transdisciplinary analyses and a major conclusion of this synthesis paper is that there is a need for further development of the integrated approaches, which considers all four types of capital (human, built, natural, and social), and their interaction at spatially explicit, multiple scales. This should be facilitated by adapting existing models and make them and their outcomes more accessible to stakeholders. Other shortcomings and caveats of models should be addressed by adding the ‘human factor’, for instance, in participatory decision-making and scenario testing. For integration of the models themselves, a more participatory approach to model development is also recommended, along with the possibility of adding advanced gaming interfaces to the models to allow them to be “played” by a large number of interested parties and their trade-off decisions to be accumulated and compared.},

To restore 15\% of degraded ecosystems as stipulated by the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi target 15, we developed a prioritization framework to identify potential priority sites for restoration in Mexico, a megadiverse country. We used the most current biological and environmental data on Mexico to assess areas of biological importance and restoration feasibility at national scale and engaged stakeholders and experts throughout the process. We integrated 8 criteria into 2 components (i.e., biological importance and restoration feasibility) in a spatial multicriteria analysis and generated 11 scenarios to test the effect of assigning different component weights. The priority restoration sites were distributed across all terrestrial ecosystems of Mexico; 64.1\% were in degraded natural vegetation and 6\% were in protected areas. Our results provide a spatial guide to where restoration could enhance the persistence of species of conservation concern and vulnerable ecosystems while maximizing the likelihood of restoration success. Such spatial prioritization is a first step in informing policy makers and restoration planners where to focus local and large?scale restoration efforts, which should additionally incorporate social and monetary cost?benefit considerations.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened tropical biomes, with much of the standing forest in small (less than 50ha), disturbed and isolated patches. The pattern of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) which has resulted in this critical scenario has not yet been fully investigated. Here, we describe the LULCC in three Atlantic Forest fragmented landscapes (São Paulo, Brazil) between 1960–1980s and 1980–2000s. The three studied landscapes differ in the current proportion of forest cover, having 10\%, 30\% and 50\% respectively. Between the 1960s and 1980s, forest cover of two landscapes was reduced while the forest cover in the third landscape increased slightly. The opposite trend was observed between the 1980s and 2000s; forest regeneration was greater than deforestation at the landscapes with 10\% and 50\% of forest cover and, as a consequence, forest cover increased. By contrast, the percentage of forest cover at the landscape with 30\% of forest cover was drastically reduced between the 1980s and 2000s. LULCC deviated from a random trajectory, were not constant through time in two study landscapes and were not constant across space in a given time period. This landscape dynamism in single locations over small temporal scales is a key factor to be considered in models of LULCC to accurately simulate future changes for the Atlantic Forest. In general, forest patches became more isolated when deforestation was greater than forest regeneration and became more connected when forest regeneration was greater than deforestation. As a result of the dynamic experienced by the study landscapes, individual forest patches currently consist of a mosaic of different forest age classes which is likely to impact biodiversity. Furthermore, landscape dynamics suggests the beginning of a forest transition in some Atlantic Forest regions, what could be of great importance for biodiversity conservation due to the potential effects of young secondary forests in reducing forest isolation and maintaining a significant amount of the original biodiversity.},

Mitigation policies are transitioning from traditional project-by-project planning to landscape-level planning. Although this larger-scale approach is expected to provide greater conservation benefits at the lowest cost, empirical justification is still scarce. Using commercial sugarcane expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado as a case study, we apply economic and biophysical steady-state models to quantify the benefits of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC) under landscape- and property-level planning. We find that FC compliance imposes small costs to business but can generate significant long-term benefits to nature: supporting 32 (±37) additional species (largely habitat specialists), storing 593,000 to 2,280,000 additional tons of carbon worth \$69 million to \$265 million (\$ pertains to U.S. dollars), and marginally improving surface water quality. Relative to property-level compliance, we find that landscape-level compliance reduces total business costs by \$19 million to \$35 million per 6-year sugarcane growing cycle while often supporting more species and storing more carbon. Our results demonstrate that landscape-level mitigation provides cost-effective conservation and can be used to promote sustainable development.

With few exceptions, ecological restoration studies that include economics focus solely on evaluating costs of restoration projects. However, economic principles, tools, and instruments can be applied to a range of other factors that affect project success. We considered the relevance of applying economics to address 4 key challenges of ecological restoration: assessing social and economic benefits, estimating overall costs, project prioritization and selection, and long?term financing of restoration programs. We found it is uncommon to consider all types of benefits (such as nonmarket values) and costs (such as transaction costs) in restoration programs. Total benefit of a restoration project can be estimated using market prices and various nonmarket valuation techniques. Total cost of a project can be estimated using methods based on property or land?sale prices, such as hedonic pricing method and organizational surveys. Securing continuous (or long?term) funding is also vital to accomplishing restoration goals and can be achieved by establishing synergy with existing programs, public?private partnerships, and financing through taxation.},

	abstract = {In some agricultural regions, reservation of remnant natural lands will not maintain the natural biodiversity and large-scale ecological restoration is required. Geographic planning for restoration is essential to obtain the maximum ecological benefit from the limited resources available for landscape restoration. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept that implements principles of systematic conservation planning, such as adequacy, representativeness, efficiency and flexibility, within an integer programming framework to identify geographic priorities for landscape restoration in a small catchment in South Australia. Integer programming ensures maximally efficient solutions that meet conservation targets in the form of minimum proportions (30\%) and minimum areas (15ha) of each environment type. However, the optimum solution identifies a system of scattered sites with an inadequate and impractical landscape structure. We propose a system of impedance surfaces that prioritise the spatial location of restoration towards improving landscape structure. Different options for systematic landscape restoration are assessed and the costs of spatial prioritisation of areas is found to be either optimal or very near optimal regardless of the impedances used. Thus, the cost of spatial prioritisation of sites for restoration in the landscape is negligible. We suggest the proposed methodology fits within a broader plan for landscape restoration and natural resource management.},

Increasingly, prioritizations seek to account for spatial heterogeneity in the costs of conservation, motivated in part by claims of large efficiency savings when these costs are included. I critically review the cost estimates on which such claims are based, focusing on acquisition and management costs associated with terrestrial protected areas. If researchers are to evaluate how including costs affects conservation planning outcomes, estimation methods need to preserve the covariation between and relative variation within costs and benefits of conservation activities. However, widely used methods for estimating costs and incorporating them into prioritizations may not meet these standards. For example, among relevant studies, there is surprisingly little attention given to the costs that conservation organizations actually face. Instead, there is a heavy reliance on untested proxies for conservation costs. Analytical shortcuts are also common. Now that debate is moving beyond whether to account for costs in conservation planning, it is time to evaluate just how we can include them to greatest effect.},

	abstract = {Background Prioritization schemes usually highlight species-rich areas, where many species are at imminent risk of extinction. To be ecologically relevant these schemes should also include species biological traits into area-setting methods. Furthermore, in a world of limited funds for conservation, conservation action is constrained by land acquisition costs. Hence, including economic costs into conservation priorities can substantially improve their conservation cost-effectiveness. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined four global conservation scenarios for carnivores based on the joint mapping of economic costs and species biological traits. These scenarios identify the most cost-effective priority sets of ecoregions, indicating best investment opportunities for safeguarding every carnivore species, and also establish priority sets that can maximize species representation in areas harboring highly vulnerable species. We compared these results with a scenario that minimizes the total number of ecoregions required for conserving all species, irrespective of other factors. We found that cost-effective conservation investments should focus on 41 ecoregions highlighted in the scenario that consider simultaneously both ecoregion vulnerability and economic costs of land acquisition. Ecoregions included in priority sets under these criteria should yield best returns of investments since they harbor species with high extinction risk and have lower mean land cost. Conclusions/Significance Our study highlights ecoregions of particular importance for the conservation of the world's carnivores defining global conservation priorities in analyses that encompass socioeconomic and life-history factors. We consider the identification of a comprehensive priority-set of areas as a first step towards an in-situ biodiversity maintenance strategy.},

Based on what has been done in this biome, we try to summarize the main findings and challenges for restoration in this highly threatened forest biome. We found that many past experiences did not result in self-perpetuating forests, for different reasons. Currently, most projects aim to construct self-sustaining communities and no longer see restoration as a deterministic process. We also found that the reconstruction of permanent forest with high diversity is feasible but it depends on the strategies applied and on the surrounding landscape. Although many new techniques have been created (e.g. seed rain management or promotion of natural regeneration), the most used one in the Atlantic Forest is still the planting of many native species from different functional groups. Native species are largely used and perform well even in highly disturbed environments. Today, many projects are trying to produce thousands of hectares of permanent forests and many technical advances are about to be incorporated. But restoration also faces some main challenges to become an effective and widespread means of conserving the Atlantic Forest which are, namely, reducing costs, planning restoration actions at landscape-level, and conforming to socio-political issues. The socio-political tools to overcome such barriers in practice have yet to be developed.},

	abstract = {Global agricultural feeds over 7 billion people, but is also a leading cause of environmental degradation. Understanding how alternative agricultural production systems, agricultural input efficiency, and food choice drive environmental degradation is necessary for reducing agriculture’s environmental impacts. A meta-analysis of life cycle assessments that includes 742 agricultural systems and over 90 unique foods produced primarily in high-input systems shows that, per unit of food, organic systems require more land, cause more eutrophication, use less energy, but emit similar greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) as conventional systems; that grass-fed beef requires more land and emits similar GHG emissions as grain-feed beef; and that low-input aquaculture and non-trawling fisheries have much lower GHG emissions than trawling fisheries. In addition, our analyses show that increasing agricultural input efficiency (the amount of food produced per input of fertilizer or feed) would have environmental benefits for both crop and livestock systems. Further, for all environmental indicators and nutritional units examined, plant-based foods have the lowest environmental impacts; eggs, dairy, pork, poultry, non-trawling fisheries, and non-recirculating aquaculture have intermediate impacts; and ruminant meat has impacts ∼100 times those of plant-based foods. Our analyses show that dietary shifts towards low-impact foods and increases in agricultural input use efficiency would offer larger environmental benefits than would switches from conventional agricultural systems to alternatives such as organic agriculture or grass-fed beef.},

However, its implementation raises enormous political, technological, and social challenges. Meeting these challenges will require, among other things, accurate information on the spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural land use and yield. Here, we investigate historical patterns of agricultural land use (1940?2012) and productivity (1990?2012) in Brazil using a new high?resolution (approximately 1 km2) spatially explicit reconstruction. Although Brazilian agriculture has been historically known for its extensification over natural vegetation (Amazon and Cerrado), data from recent years indicate that extensification has slowed down and was replaced by a strong trend of intensification. Our results provide the first comprehensive historical overview of agricultural land use and productivity in Brazil, providing clear insights to guide future territorial planning, sustainable agriculture, policy, and decision?making.},

	abstract = {Providing food and other products to a growing human population while safeguarding natural ecosystems and the provision of their services is a significant scientific, social and political challenge. With food demand likely to double over the next four decades, anthropization is already driving climate change and is the principal force behind species extinction, among other environmental impacts. The sustainable intensification of production on current agricultural lands has been suggested as a key solution to the competition for land between agriculture and natural ecosystems. However, few investigations have shown the extent to which these lands can meet projected demands while considering biophysical constraints. Here we investigate the improved use of existing agricultural lands and present insights into avoiding future competition for land. We focus on Brazil, a country projected to experience the largest increase in agricultural production over the next four decades and the richest nation in terrestrial carbon and biodiversity. Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil's 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32–34\% of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49–52\% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems. As a result up to 14.3Gt CO2 Eq could be mitigated. The fact that the country poised to undergo the largest expansion of agricultural production over the coming decades can do so without further conversion of natural habitats provokes the question whether the same can be true in other regional contexts and, ultimately, at the global scale.},

In this article, we seek to understand these dynamics of ‘adverse incorporation’ in the context of Brazilian agriculture, focusing on the extreme ends of the spectrum of exploitation associated with what, in Brazil, is usually termed ‘slave labour’. We explore two questions which reveal the circular character of adverse incorporation. First, to what extent, in what ways and under what circumstances does chronic poverty foster patterns of precarious and exploitative employment within GPNs for poor workers? Second, to what extent, in what ways and under what circumstances can the workings of GPNs, and the terms on which poorer workers are incorporated into them, be said to produce and reproduce chronic poverty?},

	abstract = {Whilst a number of studies have examined the effects of biodiversity conservation on the delivery of ecosystem services, they are often limited in the scope of the ecosystem services (ES) assessed and can suffer from confounding spatial issues. This paper examines the impacts of nature conservation on the delivery of a full suite of ES across nine case studies in the UK, using expert opinion. The case studies covered a range of habitats and explore the delivery of ES from a 'protected site' and a comparable 'non-protected' site. By conducting pair-wise comparisons of ES delivery between comparable sites our study attempts to mitigate confounding cause and effect factors in relation to spatial context in correlative studies. The analysis showed that protected sites deliver higher levels of ecosystem services than non-protected sites, with the main differences being in the cultural and regulating ecosystem services. Against expectations, there was no consistent negative impact of protection on provisioning services across these case studies. Whilst the analysis demonstrated general patterns in ES delivery between protected and non-protected sites, the individual responses in each case study highlights the importance of the local social, biophysical, economic and temporal context of individual protected areas and the associated management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Employing a set of survey data from users and nonusers of state-owned recreation and conservation areas in Finland, we derive two measures for distributional analysis. The first, the income elasticity of willingness to pay for recreation services, indicates that public provision of recreation benefits lower-income groups more than higher-income groups. The second, a welfare measure including efficiency loss, reveals ambiguous impacts depending on the level of the fee implemented. Low fee levels decrease recreation visits among lower-income users, whereas high fees reduce the welfare level of higher-income users in particular. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over 140 Mha of restoration commitments have been pledged across the global tropics, yet guidance is needed to identify those landscapes where implementation is likely to provide the greatest potential benefits and cost-effective outcomes. By overlaying seven recent, peer-reviewed spatial datasets as proxies for socioenvironmental benefits and feasibility of restoration, we identified restoration opportunities (areas with higher potential return of benefits and feasibility) in lowland tropical rainforest landscapes. We found restoration opportunities throughout the tropics. Areas scoring in the top 10\% (i.e., restoration hotspots) are located largely within conservation hotspots (88\%) and in countries committed to the Bonn Challenge (73\%), a global effort to restore 350 Mha by 2030. However, restoration hotspots represented only a small portion (19.1\%) of the Key Biodiversity Area network. Concentrating restoration investments in landscapes with high benefits and feasibility would maximize the potential to mitigate anthropogenic impacts and improve human well-being.
Assessment of socioenvironmental benefits and feasibility identifies priority areas for restoring global tropical rainforests.

	abstract = {Closing yield gaps within existing croplands, and thereby avoiding further habitat conversions, is a prominently and controversially discussed strategy to meet the rising demand for agricultural products, while minimizing biodiversity impacts. The agricultural intensification associated with such a strategy poses additional threats to biodiversity within agricultural landscapes. The uneven spatial distribution of both yield gaps and biodiversity provides opportunities for reconciling agricultural intensification and biodiversity conservation through spatially optimized intensification. Here, we integrate distribution and habitat information for almost 20,000 vertebrate species with land-cover and land-use datasets. We estimate that projected agricultural intensification between 2000 and 2040 would reduce the global biodiversity value of agricultural lands by 11\%, relative to 2000. Contrasting these projections with spatial land-use optimization scenarios reveals that 88\% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through globally coordinated land-use planning, implying huge efficiency gains through international cooperation. However, global-scale optimization also implies a highly uneven distribution of costs and benefits, resulting in distinct “winners and losers” in terms of national economic development, food security, food sovereignty or conservation. Given conflicting national interests and lacking effective governance mechanisms to guarantee equitable compensation of losers, multinational land-use optimization seems politically unlikely. In turn, 61\% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through nationally focused optimization, and 33\% through optimization within just 10 countries. Targeted efforts to improve the capacity for integrated land-use planning for sustainable intensification especially in these countries, including the strengthening of institutions that can arbitrate subnational land-use conflicts, may offer an effective, yet politically feasible, avenue to better reconcile future trade-offs between agriculture and conservation. The efficiency gains of optimization remained robust when assuming that yields could only be increased to 80\% of their potential. Our results highlight the need to better integrate real-world governance, political and economic challenges into sustainable development and global change mitigation research.},

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

In by far the largest analysis of this question to date and not restricted to forested PAs, we compiled data from 12,315 PAs across 152 countries to investigate their ability to reduce human pressure and how this varies with socioeconomic and management circumstances. While many PAs show positive outcomes, strikingly we find that compared with matched unprotected areas, PAs have on average not reduced a compound index of pressure change over the past 15 y. Moreover, in tropical regions average pressure change from cropland conversion has increased inside PAs even more than in matched unprotected areas. However, our results also confirm previous studies restricted to forest PAs, where pressures are increasing, but less than in counterfactual areas. Our results also show that countries with high national-level development scores have experienced lower rates of pressure increase over the past 15 y within their PAs compared with a matched outside area. Our results caution against the rapid establishment of new PAs without simultaneously addressing the conditions needed to enable their success.},

Easements can provide a range of ecosystem services (ESs), but it is unknown whether conservation easements maintain ES capacities equivalent to public protected areas. Evaluation of the capacity of seven ESs on federal and state protected areas and conservation easements in the USA using spatially-explicit ES models and publicly available data indicated that ES capacities in easements were equal to or greater than capacities within state or federal protected areas for six of seven services and, when bundled together, conservation easements protected greater focal ES capacity than other conservation areas. Economic incentive programmes and regulatory mechanisms may be used to stimulate capacity improvements for surface water regulation, riparian filtration, erosion control, and carbon storage on conservation easements, and landscape-level conservation efforts should (1) continue to protect natural and uninhabited areas that provide ecosystem and biological diversity, (2) expand private conservation efforts close to human population centres, and (3) limit future development to areas with high regulating service capacity that can sustain new population growth.},

	abstract = {The future of nature's contributions
A recent Global Assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has emphasized the urgent need to determine where and how nature's contribution matters most to people. Chaplin-Kramer et al. have developed a globalscale modeling of ecosystem services, focusing on water quality regulation, coastal protection, and crop pollination (see the Perspective by Balvanera). By 2050, up to 5 billion people may be at risk from diminishing ecosystem services, particularly in Africa and South Asia.
Science, this issue p. 255; see also p. 184
The magnitude and pace of global change demand rapid assessment of nature and its contributions to people. We present a fine-scale global modeling of current status and future scenarios for several contributions: water quality regulation, coastal risk reduction, and crop pollination. We find that where people’s needs for nature are now greatest, nature’s ability to meet those needs is declining. Up to 5 billion people face higher water pollution and insufficient pollination for nutrition under future scenarios of land use and climate change, particularly in Africa and South Asia. Hundreds of millions of people face heightened coastal risk across Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas. Continued loss of nature poses severe threats, yet these can be reduced 3- to 10-fold under a sustainable development scenario.
Projections to 2050 show up to 5 billion people at risk of water pollution, coastal storms, and deficient crop pollination.

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of the Atlantic Rainforest loss and recovery are still not fully understood despite its long history of human occupation. In this study, we investigated changes in an Atlantic Rainforest region due to major biophysical and human proximate causes. First, we modeled land-cover and land-use changes from 1962 to 2000, including deforestation and forest regrowth, and thereby simulated future landscape trajectories to assess their possible effects on the conservation of forest species of the Ibiúna Plateau, a region located in Southeastern Brazil within the Atlantic Rainforest biome. We modeled four scenarios (status quo, random, law enforcement, and land-use intensification) and simulated their resulting landscape trajectories for the year 2019 using DINAMICA. The landscape dynamics in the study region were particularly intense. During the first period of 1962–1981, the rate of forest regrowth (3\% year−1) was greater than the rate of deforestation (2\% year−1), whereas in the latter period of 1981–2000, increasing urbanization and the spreading of rural establishments resulted in more deforestation (2.9\% year−1) than regrowth (1\% year−1). These dynamics imprinted a heterogeneous landscape, leading to the predominance of progressively younger secondary forests with increasingly less capacity of hosting sensitive forest species. The influence of proximate causes on the dynamics of deforestation and forest regrowth showed consistent patterns, such as higher forest regrowth rates near rivers, on steep slopes and far from dirt roads, whereas losses in young secondary vegetation and forest were far from rivers, on gentle slopes and near urban areas. Of the modeled scenarios, only the law enforcement scenario may lead to the recovery of a network of interconnected forest patches, suggesting that simply the enforcement of current forest laws, which prohibit deforestation on unsuitable agricultural areas and along river margins and establish a minimum of 20\% of forest remnant per rural property, may effectively favor forest species conservation in the short term (two decades) without the need of any forest restoration effort.},

However, the success of this sector has been associated with widespread destruction of Brazilian ecosystems, especially the Cerrado and the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, as well as environmental degradation. Brazil's agricultural development has also led to land consolidation, aggravating a historical land distribution inequality. This pattern of agricultural growth has reinforced Brazil’ status as one of the world's most inequitable countries in terms of income distribution, making it difficult to assert that the nation is pursuing a sustainable development path. In order to achieve sustainable development Brazil must reconcile its increasingly productive, modern tropical agricultural system with environmental preservation, social equity, and poverty alleviation in rural and urban areas. Although a daunting task, Brazil has the opportunity to lead tropical countries in combining modernized agriculture with highly diverse and functional ecosystems. Continued improvement in socio-economic conditions is equally important and will require stronger efforts to decrease inequalities in income and land distribution in the rural sector.},

	abstract = {We introduce an object-based method to automatically classify topography from SRTM data. The new method relies on the concept of decomposing land-surface complexity into more homogeneous domains. An elevation layer is automatically segmented and classified at three scale levels that represent domains of complexity by using self-adaptive, data-driven techniques. For each domain, scales in the data are detected with the help of local variance and segmentation is performed at these appropriate scales. Objects resulting from segmentation are partitioned into sub-domains based on thresholds given by the mean values of elevation and standard deviation of elevation respectively. Results resemble reasonably patterns of existing global and regional classifications, displaying a level of detail close to manually drawn maps. Statistical evaluation indicates that most of classes satisfy the regionalization requirements of maximizing internal homogeneity while minimizing external homogeneity. Most objects have boundaries matching natural discontinuities at regional level. The method is simple and fully automated. The input data consist of only one layer, which does not need any pre-processing. Both segmentation and classification rely on only two parameters: elevation and standard deviation of elevation. The methodology is implemented as a customized process for the eCognition® software, available as online download. The results are embedded in a web application with functionalities of visualization and download.},

Whether crop yield–related ecosystem services can be maintained by a few dominant species or rely on high richness remains unclear. Using a global database from 89 studies (with 1475 locations), we partition the relative importance of species richness, abundance, and dominance for pollination; biological pest control; and final yields in the context of ongoing land-use change. Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services in addition to and independent of abundance and dominance. Up to 50\% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields. Maintaining the biodiversity of ecosystem service providers is therefore vital to sustain the flow of key agroecosystem benefits to society.

	abstract = {Establishing protected areas (PAs) is one of the most common land use policies implemented by governments to maintain healthy ecosystems at different spatial scales and in distinct socioeconomic settings. However, reliable knowledge on government spending in PAs and the factors that influence this spending is limited. In this study, we describe the public spending by the Brazilian government in a set of 289 federal PAs that altogether cover an area of 743,406 km2. Then, we assess how six contextual factors (area, age, population density, human development index [HDI], ecological regions, and management group) influence this spending. From 2013–2016, the Brazilian government invested at least US\$197.8 million in 289 PAs. The average annual spending per km2 presents a wide variation, ranging from US\$0.3/km2 to US\$392,250/km2. A linear regression model indicates that (1) the annual public spending increases with PA size, PA age, human population density, and HDI; (2) multiple-use PAs receive fewer resources than strict-protection PAs do; and (3) no difference exists in the public spending in PAs between Amazon—the region perceived by the national population as the most important for Brazil’s natural resources—and other ecological regions in the country. Our study highlights the urgent need to document the flows of financial resources to PAs, with the aim of understanding their variation patterns and the processes that cause such a variation. Similar studies in other countries are required to evaluate if the patterns that we describe here are general or are country specific. Besides, separately assessing the investments coming from governments and the financial resources provided by other conservation investors (i.e., NGOs, multilateral, corporations) is worthwhile to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced view of financial flows to PAs.},

	abstract = {Brazil's environmental legislation obliges private properties to retain a fixed proportion of their total area with native vegetation, the so-called “Legal Reserves”. Those areas represent practically one third of the country's native vegetation and are well known for their role in biodiversity protection and in the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services for landowners and society. Despite their relevance, this instrument has been criticized by part of the agribusiness sector and its representatives in the Brazilian Congress. The Legal Reserve requirement is said to be too restrictive and to impede the full expansion of agricultural activities, and thus to be detrimental for the development of the country. Here, we critically analyze the arguments employed in the justification of a recently proposed bill that aims to completely extinguish Legal Reserves. We demonstrate that the arguments used are mostly unsupported by data, evidence or theory, besides being based on illogical reasoning. Further, we synthesize the principal benefits of Legal Reserves, including health and economic benefits, and emphasize the importance of these reserves for water, energy, food, and climate securities, in addition to their primary function of assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We also highlight that Legal Reserves are a key-component for effective and less expensive nature-based solutions, and thus should be considered as assets for the development of Brazil rather than liabilities. Based on available sound scientific evidence and agreement on their relevance, we strongly oppose any attempt to extinguish or weaken the maintenance of Brazil's Legal Reserves.},

Using detailed information on global crop yields of 60 pollination dependent or profiting crops, we provide a map of global pollination benefits on a 59 by 59 latitude-longitude grid. The current spatial pattern of pollination benefits is only partly correlated with climate variables and the distribution of cropland. The resulting map of pollination benefits identifies hot spots of pollination benefits at sufficient detail to guide political decisions on where to protect pollination services by investing in structural diversity of land use. Additionally, we investigated the vulnerability of the national economies with respect to potential decline of pollination services as the portion of the (agricultural) economy depending on pollination benefits. While the general dependency of the agricultural economy on pollination seems to be stable from 1993 until 2009, we see increases in producer prices for pollination dependent crops, which we interpret as an early warning signal for a conflict between pollination service and other land uses at the global scale. Our spatially explicit analysis of global pollination benefit points to hot spots for the generation of pollination benefits and can serve as a base for further planning of land use, protection sites and agricultural policies for maintaining pollination services.},

These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.},

	title = {The {Implications} of {Global} {Priorities} for {Biodiversity} and {Ecosystem} {Services} {Associated} with {Protected} {Areas}},
	abstract = {Map-based prioritization systems have become ubiquitous tools for allocating resources for biological conservation. Although the scientific basis for these systems continues to be debated, they have become a significant factor in international conservation. A recent study found that published conservation priorities are associated with over one third of conservation spending by major international nongovernmental organizations totaling over \$1.5 X 109 in 2002 alone. The growing influence of these systems on the allocation of resources for conservation underscores the need to understand their ecological and environmental implications. This paper addresses the role of global priorities in contributing to the future of land protection by considering three key questions: (1) What are the implications of business-asusual growth in land protection for the representation of biodiversity, i.e., the absence of priorities? (2) Would implementing global conservation prioritization systems change trends in biodiversity representation, i.e., conservation following priorities? (3) What are the implications of priority systemguided protected area growth for ecosystem services beyond biodiversity representation, i.e., nontarget consequences of implementation? These questions are addressed with analyses of information from the World Database for Protected Areas and the Global Gap Analysis. The results indicate that business-asusual growth in land protection will fill gaps slowly, most likely at a rate equivalent to chance. Following global priority systems would accelerate conservation of unprotected biodiversity, gap species; however, achieving these gains would exacerbate the current highly uneven global distribution of protected areas. The majority of areas targeted by priority systems already have above average levels of protection and additions following global priority systems would encourage growth in these already above average countries. Over time, these patterns could contribute to uneven distributions of important ecosystem services. This observation does not detract from the value of global priority systems for biodiversity conservation, but it does highlight their limitations and suggest the need for more comprehensive approaches to planning and prioritizing future land protection.},

	abstract = {It is theoretically possible to protect large fractions of species in relatively small regions. For plants, 85\% of species occur entirely within just over a third of the Earth’s land surface, carefully optimized to maximize the species captured. Well-known vertebrate taxa show similar patterns. Protecting half of Earth might not be necessary, but would it be sufficient given the current trends of protection? The predilection of national governments is to protect areas that are “wild,” that is, typically remote, cold, or arid. Unfortunately, those areas often hold relatively few species. Wild places likely afford the easier opportunities for the future expansion of protected areas, with the expansion into human-dominated landscapes the greater challenge. We identify regions that are not currently protected, but that are wild, and consider which of them hold substantial numbers of especially small-ranged vertebrate species. We assess how successful the strategy of protecting the wilder half of Earth might be in conserving biodiversity. It is far from sufficient. (Protecting large wild places for reasons other than biodiversity protection, such as carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, might still have importance.) Unexpectedly, we also show that, despite the bias in establishing large protected areas in wild places to date, numerous small protected areas are in biodiverse places. They at least partially protect significant fractions of especially small-ranged species. So, while a preoccupation with protecting large areas for the sake of getting half of Earth might achieve little for biodiversity, there is more progress in protecting high-biodiversity areas than currently appreciated. Continuing to prioritize the right parts of Earth, not just the total area protected, is what matters for biodiversity.
Just protecting Earth’s wilderness will not be sufficient to conserve most of its species; quality, not overall size, matters.

The land management literature is scarce in the spatially integrated analysis of biophysical and socio-economic data. Localized land management decisions are likely driven by spatially-explicit but often unobserved resource conditions, influenced by an individual’s own characteristics, proximal lands and fellow owners. This study examined stated choices over the management of family-owned forests as an example of a resource that captures strong pecuniary and non-pecuniary values with identifiable decision makers. An autoregressive model controlled for spatially autocorrelated willingness-to-harvest (WTH) responses using a sample of residential and absentee family forest owners from the U.S. State of Missouri. WTH responses were largely explained by affective, cognitive and experience variables including timber production objectives and past harvest experience. Demographic variables, including income and age, were associated with WTH and helped define socially-proximal groups. The group of closest identity was comprised of resident males over 55 years of age with annual income of at least \$50,000. Spatially-explicit models showed that indirect impacts, capturing spillover associations, on average accounted for 14\% of total marginal impacts among statistically significant explanatory variables. We argue that not all proximal family forest owners are equal and owners-in-absentia have discernible differences in WTH preferences with important implications for public policy and future research.},

	abstract = {The increasing popularity of private land conservation (PLC) globally has quickly translated into an array of polices and programs aimed at achieving ecological benefits. The growth of PLC is entwined with the rise of neoliberal governance, with private land proving congruous with the promotion of market-based instruments (MBIs) and the reliance on private protected areas for conservation in lieu of government investment in public lands. Despite a growing literature on the implications of neoliberal environmental governance, there remains a need for specific insights into the way that individual landholders and ecologies can co-opt or resist the rationalities of MBIs in the practice of private land conservation. Through semi-structured interviews and property walks with 18 landholders, this research examines the implementation of a reverse-auction tender scheme called `EcoTender' in Victoria, Australia. We uncovered four main tensions between the market logic of the program and conservation practice: 1) some landholders used the payment scheme to increase regulatory protections on their property through covenants/easements; 2) many landholders struggled to conceive of their stewardship practice as contractual labour; 3) landholders were producing novel ecosystems that challenged land management focused at the property parcel scale when EcoTender encouraged a return to historical benchmark ecologies, and; 4) many landholders wanted social collaboration when the program required competition for cost efficiency. Our insights show that PLC must create room for a diverse trajectory of conservation practice in dynamic socio-ecological contexts. This means careful reflection on the validity of assumptions underpinning MBIs, the trade-offs that come with applying market logic to conservation and the long-term implications of these instruments for policy and practice.},

We conducted a spatial and temporal analysis of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) to understand the patterns of regulatory compliance over time and across changes in the policy, and the implications of these compliance patterns for the perceived costs to landholders and environmental performance of agricultural landscapes in the southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso. Landholdings tended to remain in compliance or not according to their status at the beginning of the study period. The perceived economic burden of BFC compliance on soya bean and beef producers (US\$3–5.6 billion in net present value of the land) may in part explain the massive, successful campaign launched by the farm lobby to change the BFC. The ecological benefits of compliance (e.g. greater connectivity and carbon) with the BFC are diffuse and do not compete effectively with the economic benefits of non-compliance that are perceived by landholders. Volatile regulation of land-use decisions that affect billions in economic rent that could be captured is an inadequate forest governance instrument; effectiveness of such regulations may increase when implemented in tandem with positive incentives for forest conservation.},

	abstract = {This article addresses deforestation processes in the Amazon basin, using regression analysis to assess the impact of household structure and economic circumstances on land use decisions made by colonist farmers in the forest frontiers of Brazil. Unlike many previous regression-based studies, the methodology implemented analyzes behavior at the level of the individual property, using both survey data and information derived from the classification of remotely sensed imagery. The regressions correct for endogenous relationships between key variables and spatial autocorrelation, as necessary. Variables used in the analysis are specified, in part, by a theoretical development integrating the Chayanovian concept of the peasant household with spatial considerations stemming from von Thünen. Results from the empirical model indicate that demographic characteristics of households, as well as market factors, affect deforestation in the Amazon basin associated with colonists. Therefore, statistical results from studies that do not include household-scale information may be subject to error. From a policy perspective, the results suggest that environmental policies in the Amazon based on market incentives to small farmers may not be as effective as hoped, given the importance of household factors in catalyzing the demand for land. The article concludes by noting that household decisions regarding land use and deforestation are not independent of broader social circumstances, and that a full understanding of Amazonian deforestation will require insight into why poor families find it necessary to settle the frontier in the first place.},

	abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.

A review of the literature, data analysis, and interviews with experts in the logistics chain revealed that a lack of grain storage, overreliance on trucking, poor road conditions, and inefficient operations at rail terminals and ports impede a smooth flow of grain from farm to port. Because of the comparatively low per-unit values of agricultural bulk commodities, transportation may account for a large share of the total cost of soybean exports. As a result, it was hypothesized that increases in transportation costs may reduce farm-gate prices, affecting producer profitability and, thus, national production. To test that hypothesis, this study examined transportation costs from inland production regions to traffic hubs and the Santos seaport. A comparison of theoretical producer prices calculated based on logistics costs versus actual local prices was employed to confirm that transport inefficiencies have led to depressed farm gate prices.},

	abstract = {In increasingly competitive conditions, the dominant trend of enlarging the production area of farms is causing a growth in transportation costs making the profitability of cultivating distant plots questionable. The aim of this study was to provide a method to evaluate the rationality of using a plot depending on its distance, area and cultivation technology. An algorithm and a mathematical model were composed to calculate the total costs depending on the distance to the plot. The transportation costs of machines and materials, cost of organisational travel and timeliness costs are taken into account in the model to enable determination of the maximum distance or the minimum area of the plot necessary for profitable cultivation. Simulations allow us to conclude that the growth in yield and selling price of the production allow an increase in the limit value of driving costs and, thus, the profitable distance of the plot; on the other hand, it means also an increase of timeliness costs as a limitation for extending distance. Exploitation of more distant plots can be uneconomical in coming years because of increasing fuel costs.;},

	abstract = {Unravelling the psychological processes determining landowners’ support towards forest conservation is crucial, particularly in rural areas of the tropics, where most forest remnants are within private lands. As human–nature connections are known to shape pro-environmental behaviours, the intention of preserving forest remnants should ultimately be determined by the ecological context people live in. Here, we investigate the pathways through which the ecological context (forest cover), via direct contact with forests and ecosystem services and disservices, influence the psychological antecedents of conservation behaviour (beliefs, attitude and intention of preserving forest remnants). We conceptualized a model based on the Reasoned Action Approach, using the ecological context and these three forest experiences as background factors, and tested the model using Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling. Data were collected through an interview-based protocol applied to 106 landowners across 13 landscapes varying in forest cover in a consolidated rural region in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results indicate that: (a) ecosystem services are more important than disservices for shaping intention of preserving forests, particularly non-provisioning services; (b) contact with forest has an indirect effect on intention, by positively influencing the frequency of receiving ecosystem services; (c) people living in more forested ecological contexts have more contact with forests, receive ecosystem services more frequently and, ultimately, have stronger intention of preserving forests. Hence, our study suggests a dangerous positive feedback loop between deforestation, the extinction of forest experiences and impairment of human–nature connections. Local demands across the full range of ecosystem services, the balance between services and disservices and the ecological context people live in should be considered when developing conservation initiatives in tropical rural areas.

However, our new land-cover map, prepared at the highest resolution ever (5m), reveals a current vegetation cover of 28\%, or 32 million hectares (Mha) of native vegetation. Simultaneously, we found 7.2Mha of degraded riparian areas, of which 5.2Mha at least must be restored before 2038 by landowners for legislation compliance. Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35\%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups. If undertaken, this process can be adaptive to climate change and boost sustainable development in this most populous biome in Brazil, turning it into a hopespot.},

	abstract = {Recent global assessments have shown the limited coverage of protected areas across tropical biotas, fuelling a growing interest in the potential conservation services provided by anthropogenic landscapes. Here we examine the geographic distribution of biological diversity in the Atlantic Forest of South America, synthesize the most conspicuous forest biodiversity responses to human disturbances, propose further conservation initiatives for this biota, and offer a range of general insights into the prospects of forest species persistence in human-modified tropical forest landscapes worldwide. At the biome scale, the most extensive pre-Columbian habitats across the Atlantic Forest ranged across elevations below 800masl, which still concentrate most areas within the major centers of species endemism. Unfortunately, up to 88\% of the original forest habitat has been lost, mainly across these low to intermediate elevations, whereas protected areas are clearly skewed towards high elevations above 1200masl. At the landscape scale, most remaining Atlantic Forest cover is embedded within dynamic agro-mosaics including elements such as small forest fragments, early-to-late secondary forest patches and exotic tree monocultures. In this sort of aging or long-term modified landscapes, habitat fragmentation appears to effectively drive edge-dominated portions of forest fragments towards an early-successional system, greatly limiting the long-term persistence of forest-obligate and forest-dependent species. However, the extent to which forest habitats approach early-successional systems, thereby threatening the bulk of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity, depends on both past and present landscape configuration. Many elements of human-modified landscapes (e.g. patches of early-secondary forests and tree monocultures) may offer excellent conservation opportunities, but they cannot replace the conservation value of protected areas and hitherto unprotected large patches of old-growth forests. Finally, the biodiversity conservation services provided by anthropogenic landscapes across Atlantic Forest and other tropical forest regions can be significantly augmented by coupling biodiversity corridor initiatives with biota-scale attempts to plug existing gaps in the representativeness of protected areas.},

	abstract = {In fragmented landscapes, changes in habitat availability, patch size, shape and isolation may affect survival of local populations. Proposing efficient conservation strategies for such species relies initially on distinguishing the particular effects of those factors. To address these issues, we investigated the occurrence of 3 bird species in fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest landscapes. Playback techniques were used to collect presence/absence data of these species inside 80 forest patches, and incidence models were used to infer their occupancy pattern from landscape spatial structure. The relative importance of patch size, shape and surrounding forest cover and isolation was assessed using a model selection approach based on maximum likelihood estimation. The presence of all species was in general positively affected by the amount of surrounding habitat and negatively affected by inter-patch distances. The joint effects of patch size and the surrounding landscape characteristics were important determinants of occupancy for two species. The third species was affected only by forest cover and mean patch isolation. Our results suggest that local species presence is in general more influenced by the isolation from surrounding forests than by patch size alone. We found evidence that, in highly fragmented landscapes, birds that can not find patches large enough to settle may be able to overcome short distances through the matrix and include several nearby patches within their home-ranges to complement their resource needs. In these cases, patches must be defined as functionally connected habitat networks rather than mere continuous forest segments. Bird conservation strategies in the Atlantic forest should focus on increasing patch density and connectivity, in order to implement forest networks that reduce the functional isolation between large remnants with remaining core habitat.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate that the total amount of forest and the size and connectivity of fragments have nonlinear effects on species survival. We tested how habitat amount and configuration affect understory bird species richness and abundance. We used mist nets (almost 34,000 net hours) to sample birds in 53 Atlantic Forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. Fragments were distributed among 3 10,800-ha landscapes. The remaining forest in these landscapes was below (10\% forest cover), similar to (30\%), and above (50\%) the theoretical fragmentation threshold (approximately 30\%) below which the effects of fragmentation should be intensified. Species-richness estimates were significantly higher (F= 3715, p = 0.00) where 50\% of the forest remained, which suggests a species occurrence threshold of 30–50\% forest, which is higher than usually occurs ({\textless}30\%). Relations between forest cover and species richness differed depending on species sensitivity to forest conversion and fragmentation. For less sensitive species, species richness decreased as forest cover increased, whereas for highly sensitive species the opposite occurred. For sensitive species, species richness and the amount of forest cover were positively related, particularly when forest cover was 30–50\%. Fragment size and connectivity were related to species richness and abundance in all landscapes, not just below the 30\% threshold. Where 10\% of the forest remained, fragment size was more related to species richness and abundance than connectivity. However, the relation between connectivity and species richness and abundance was stronger where 30\% of the landscape was forested. Where 50\% of the landscape was forested, fragment size and connectivity were both related to species richness and abundance. Our results demonstrated a rapid loss of species at relatively high levels of forest cover (30–50\%). Highly sensitive species were 3-4 times more common above the 30–50\% threshold than below it; however, our results do not support a unique fragmentation threshold.

Our understanding of how of landscape connectivity impacts the dispersal of plants is improved by using biological traits (i.e. community functional structure). Finally, we showed that landscape connectivity promotes actual dispersal between connected communities.ConclusionsThis review emphasises the pertinence of trait-based and actual dispersal approaches to improve our understanding and ability to predict the effect of connectivity loss on plant communities, allowing us to identify new prospects for future research.},

We analyzed the economic potential for the emerging CRA market in Brazil and its implications for PES programs. Results indicate a potential market for trading 4.2 Mha of CRAs with a gross value of US\$ 9.2±2.4 billion, with main regional markets forming in the states of Mato Grosso and São Paulo. This would be the largest market for trading forests in the world. Overall, the potential supply of CRAs in Brazilian states exceeds demand, creating an opportunity for additional PES programs to use the CRA market. This expanded market could provide not only monetary incentives to conserve native vegetation, but also environmental co-benefits by fostering PES programs focused on biodiversity, water conservation, and climate regulation. Effective implementation of the Forest Code will be vital to the success of this market and this hurdle brings uncertainty into the market. Long-term commitment, both within Brazil and abroad, will be essential to overcome the many challenges ahead.},

How affordable is biodiversity conservation in a fragmented landscape? Banks-Leite et al. asked this question for the biodiversity hotspot of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. An annual investment of {\textless}10\% of Brazil's agricultural subsidies could support effective ecological restoration on private lands. This would increase biodiversity in set-aside land to the same level observed in protected areas. The cost-effectiveness of this scheme suggests a path forward for conservation strategies in other similarly mixed landscapes, too.
Science, this issue p. 1041
Ecological set-asides are a promising strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes; however, landowner participation is often precluded by financial constraints. We assessed the ecological benefits and economic costs of paying landowners to set aside private land for restoration. Benefits were calculated from data on nearly 25,000 captures of Brazilian Atlantic Forest vertebrates, and economic costs were estimated for several restoration scenarios and values of payment for ecosystem services. We show that an annual investment equivalent to 6.5\% of what Brazil spends on agricultural subsidies would revert species composition and ecological functions across farmlands to levels found inside protected areas, thereby benefiting local people. Hence, efforts to secure the future of this and other biodiversity hotspots may be cost-effective.
A small portion of Brazil’s agricultural subsidies would be enough to preserve private land in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

In the Western Cape Province of South Africa private land conservation is the focal strategy for CapeNature, the provincial conservation agency. Despite its importance, little is known about the drivers of landowner participation in the CapeNature program and how these varied motivations influence participant satisfaction and retention. Our psychometric survey of 75 enrolled landowners found that the highest ranked motivations to participate were Conservation and Place Attachment but Social Learning had a stronger influence on program satisfaction. Landowners participate to fulfill a motivation or set of motivations but their satisfaction and commitment may hinge on other unforeseen motivations or factors. Understanding the relationship between motivations, satisfaction, and commitment is necessary for a successful retention strategy in any conservation program, especially on private lands where success depends on landowner commitment.

Current literature on engagement predominantly focuses on individual case studies or specific geographical contexts, making general conclusions regarding the effect of these efforts on conservation outcomes difficult. We reviewed evidence from the peer-reviewed and grey literatures related to the role of stakeholder engagement (both externally-driven and self-organized engagement) in biodiversity conservation at the local scale using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We critically appraised and extracted data using mixed methods for case studies (n=82) and meta-analyses (n=31) published from 2011 to 2015. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on background literature references published from 2000 to 2016 (n=283). The quantitative analysis assessed multiple variables, and yielded no significant results, but suggested a possible relationship between success in producing attitudinal change towards conservation and four engagement factors. Our qualitative analysis identified six dimensions of engagement processes that are critical for successful outcomes when a project is externally-driven, and suggests that understanding of governance and social-cultural context plays an important role in all types of stakeholder engagement efforts. Finally, we reflect on the effectiveness of relying primarily on evidence available from published literature to understand links between conservation and stakeholder engagement, in particular with regard to self-organized engagement.},

Because the options have different strengths and weaknesses, are suited to different contexts, and all carry substantial risk of failure, a portfolio of biodiversity policies is likely to outperform exclusive reliance on any one strategy. Designing an effective biodiversity policy portfolio requires clarifying conservation goals, systematically evaluating existing programs, being sensitive to the context, closely monitoring policy implementation and results, and revising the portfolio as new information becomes available.},

	abstract = {A variety of tools can be employed in support of environmental policy objectives, but achieving preferred outcomes also requires the cooperation of private landholders and others with vested interests in the land. The Land Stewardship project in the state of Victoria, Australia, is an initiative devoted to exploring the ways in which private landholders could be encouraged towards more sustainable land management. Following the view that the success of policy initiatives is contingent on effective stakeholder engagement, a component of the Land Stewardship project involved a dialogue with landholders about policy tools (e.g., regulation, economic instruments) that might be deployed to encourage improved land management practices. This paper provides an account of the views and attitudes of landholders, as revealed in a series of three workshops, which consisted of discussions about the factors influencing agriculture, participants’ interpretations of sustainability, and policy methods. The focus of the paper is on what landholders believe to be the strengths and limitations of standard policy tools, and the essential requirements for these tools to deliver the best land management outcomes. One of the main findings of the project was a ‘preference hierarchy’ in respect of policy methods, according to which the strongest support was expressed for voluntary and education-based tools, followed by market-based instruments, with command-and-control regulation identified as a measure of ‘last resort’. In the paper we reflect also on how the views and outlook of landholders should be positioned relative to other inputs in the design of policy interventions.},

However, regulatory private land conservation continues to be dominant in several developing and transitional countries, especially in case of private land within protected areas. Poland, the study site of this research, represents such an example where private land conservation is restricted to only those within protected areas. Use of regulatory approach can have an influence on landowners’ attitude toward private land conservation that is in contrast to attitudes toward voluntary approaches. The paper presents the results of a quantitative survey conducted with private landowners in three forms of protected areas in Poland (a national park, a landscape park and a Natura 2000 site) to assess their attitude toward private land conservation and analyze factors (socio-demographic, economic and external) that influence this expressed attitude. This being the first research on private land conservation in Poland, the results characterized a typical private landowner in Poland whose land is part of a protected area. It also revealed that except for education and landowners’ conservation ethic, none of the socio-demographic and economic variables had a strong influence on building conservation opportunity. However, external factors such as the type of protected area and imposed regulations did have an influence. Finally, the research highlighted the lack of sufficient institutional structures and existing gap in communication between the stakeholder groups which need to be addressed in building conservation opportunity for effective management of such mixed models of protected areas.},

However, involving private lands in conserving a public good face continuous challenges. While examining landowners’ motivations for conserving their land is imperative to its success, it is equally important to assess how other stakeholder groups perceive private land conservation. In order to capture the diversity and contrasts in implementing private land conservation, this research focuses on investigating the managerial perspectives on the status of private land conservation in two countries: USA and Poland. The paper presents the results of twenty five in-depth interviews that were conducted in the two countries. The US context, with a longer history and experience, captured complex interactions and factors that influence private land conservation, including role of conservation policies, civic sector organizations, stakeholder collaboration, technical and financial support, and nonmonetary motivations of landowners. The Polish context however, was limited to the regulatory model and as such did not differentiate private land conservation from traditional protected areas. Additionally, the lack of voluntary initiatives along with adequate policies and lack of awareness on private land conservation at a national and local level contributed to limited scope and understanding on the subject. The two case studies highlight the context dependency of such a strategy and bring to focus some of the factors that should be addressed while adopting conservation on private land as a biodiversity conservation strategy.},

Most protected areas are members of networks that are formed by ecological, social, and economic interactions (such as animal dispersal, exchanges of management expertise, and tourism). These connections influence private land conservation area sustainability but little is known about them. We interviewed 90 private land conservation area managers and 30 statutory reserve managers in the Western Cape Province of South Africa about their interactions with other managers (sharing knowledge, resources or equipment; trading in wildlife; and engaging in discussions and/or forming collaborations with surrounding managers about education, research, tourism, marketing, legislation and/or finances). Twenty-one private land managers had no interactions with other protected area managers. The full network had 199 nodes (managers) and 460 links (socioeconomic interactions). Private land conservation areas were sparsely connected, with a degree of 4.61. Projected convergence of mean diameter between real and randomly generated networks at sample sizes equivalent to the full network suggested that private land conservation area managers do not form the tightly connected social groups that would be consistent with preferential attachment. Statutory protected areas were central in the network, which had 21 different communities. Despite their potential value, socioeconomic interactions were underexploited by private land conservation areas. Fostering collaboration in private land conservation networks should enhance their long-term sustainability and effectiveness, increasing their global conservation contribution. Improving support networks for private land conservation areas will involve both the creation of bridging organizations that improve connectivity and the further development of enabling policies and legislation.},

We reviewed peer-reviewed literature focussing on PLC to summarize past scientific evidence and to identify research trends and gaps to direct future research. We carried out an in-depth review of 284 scientific articles and analysed where, when and in what context PLC has been studied. Specifically, we (i) assessed where and when PLC studies took place and which topics they covered; (ii) identified the most addressed conservation actions and policy instruments, and (iii) investigated whether stakeholders' engagement during research processes was reported or not. We found that (i) there has been an increase in the number of scientific PLC publications over time; (ii) 78\% of the articles in scientific journals focussed on four countries only (United States of America, Australia, South Africa and Canada); (iii) literature content focussed mostly on easements, programs and landowners and showed both geographical and temporal differences; (iv) land/water protection, law and policy and livelihood, economic and other incentives were the most addressed conservation actions; (v) property rights, particularly conservation easements, were the most addressed policy instrument; and (vi) half of the articles did not report the engagement of any stakeholder sector and cross-sector stakeholders' engagement was often missing. Overall, our results highlight the need for future studies on PLC to cover currently underrepresented regions; to assess the effectiveness of more conservation actions and policy instruments; and to test how engaging different stakeholders can potentially promote legitimate and equitable PLC policies across contexts.},

	abstract = {To contribute to the aspirations of recent international biodiversity conventions, protected areas (PAs) must be strategically located and not simply established on economically marginal lands as they have in the past. With refined international commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity to target protected areas in places of “importance to biodiversity,” perhaps they may now be. We analyzed location biases in PAs globally over historic (pre-2004) and recent periods. Specifically, we examined whether the location of protected areas are more closely associated with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species or with areas of low agricultural opportunity costs. We found that both old and new protected areas did not target places with high concentrations of threatened vertebrate species. Instead, they appeared to be established in locations that minimize conflict with agriculturally suitable lands. This entrenchment of past trends has substantial implications for the contributions these protected areas are making to international commitments to conserve biodiversity. If protected-area growth from 2004 to 2014 had strategically targeted unrepresented threatened vertebrates, {\textgreater}30 times more species (3086 or 2553 potential vs. 85 actual new species represented) would have been protected for the same area or the same cost as the actual expansion. With the land available for conservation declining, nations must urgently focus new protection on places that provide for the conservation outcomes outlined in international treaties.},

	abstract = {National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas (PAs) are the centerpiece of efforts to conserve biodiversity. Conservation policy and practice assume that PAs are permanent institutions, but scattered evidence suggests widespread PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD). To assess the extent, patterns, trends, causes, and consequences of PADDD, we reviewed authoritative United Nations lists of PAs (1962–2009), examined published documents, and consulted 128 conservation experts. We focused on Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, which collectively contain most global priorities for conservation and more than 70\% of the global PA estate. We identified 543 instances of PADDD in 57 countries, affecting more than 503 591km2 of protected lands and waters. The occurrence, spatial extent, timing, proximate causes, and consequences of PADDD varied widely among countries. Of the 375 PAs affected by PADDD, 76 PAs (20.3\%) were affected more than once. Thirty (5.5\%) of the 543 PADDD events were eventually partially or wholly reversed. In the absence of PA downsizing and degazettement, at least four additional countries would have already met 2020 targets for PA coverage established under the Convention on Biological Diversity. Our findings suggest that PADDD is a patchy, episodic phenomenon associated with industrial-scale natural resource extraction and development; local land pressures and land claims; and conservation planning. Though some PADDD events may foster biodiversity conservation, most PADDD suggests tradeoffs between conservation goals and other policy objectives. PADDD thus represents both a largely unrecognized threat to biodiversity and a rarely employed mechanism to strengthen conservation policy.},

Protecting undisturbed lands, although vital, is clearly insufficient, and the key role of unprotected, private land owned is being increasingly recognized. Seeking to avoid common assumptions of a social planner backed by government interventions, the present work focuses on the incentives of the individual landowner. We use detailed data to show that successful conservation on private land depends on three factors: conservation effectiveness (impact on target species), private costs (especially reductions in production), and private benefits (the extent to which conservation activities provide compensation, for example, by enhancing the value of remaining production). By examining the high-profile issue of palm-oil production in a major tropical biodiversity hotspot, we show that the levels of both conservation effectiveness and private costs are inherently spatial; varying the location of conservation activities can radically change both their effectiveness and private cost implications. We also use an economic choice experiment to show that consumers' willingness to pay for conservation-grade palm-oil products has the potential to incentivize private producers sufficiently to engage in conservation activities, supporting vulnerable International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listed species. However, these incentives vary according to the scale and efficiency of production and the extent to which conservation is targeted to optimize its cost-effectiveness. Our integrated, interdisciplinary approach shows how strategies to harness the power of the market can usefully complement existing—and to-date insufficient—approaches to conservation.},

Conservation on these private lands, next to statutory protected areas, promises to play a critical role in efforts for reaching internationally agreed environmental protection targets. Lying at the heart of an emerging land system science, in which ecology, economics, geography, psychology, and other social sciences interact, private land conservation is reflecting the intertwined and multiscalar processes of our rapidly transforming world. Situated at this disciplinary meeting point, private land conservation invites a great breadth of approaches and cross-disciplinary work that offer deep insights into social and environmental change, often from surprising angles. Although many questions remain in private land conservation, we can now build on a large body of recent high-quality studies as we push this field forward in both research and practice. The Special Feature “Private Land Conservation - Landowner Motives, Policies, and Outcomes of Conservation Measures in Unprotected Landscapes” brings together contributions that explore the diversity of recent advances in private land conservation science. As an introduction to this Special Feature, first we are reviewing recent dynamics in important social-ecological drivers with bearing on private land conservation science. We go on to introduce the individual contributions to this Special Feature and then examine common themes as they are emerging from these papers, including the need for flexibility in conservation approaches, pursuit of community cobenefits of conservation, increasing consideration of environmental justice questions, and acknowledgment of the importance of social psychology in shaping private land conservation. We conclude with identification of knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research, as we advance from diagnostics to normative work in private land conservation science.},

Using the conservation planning software Marxan with Zones we simulated different scopes for the “forest certificates” market, and compared their cost-effectiveness with that of existing command-and-control (C\&C), i.e. compliance to the Legal Reserve on own property, in the state of São Paulo. The simulations showed a clear potential of the constrained “forest certificates” market to improve conservation effectiveness and increase cost-effectiveness on allocation of Legal Reserves. Although the inclusion of an additional constraint of targeting the BIOTA Conservation Priority Areas doubled the cost (+95\%) compared with a “free trade” scenario constrained only by biome, this option was still 50\% less costly than the baseline scenario of compliance with Legal Reserve at the property.},

Focusing on forest cover change, we systematically compare the conservation effects estimated by the studies and discuss them in the light of previous findings in the literature. Nine studies estimated that annual conservation impacts on forest cover were below one percent, with two exceptions in Mexico and Indonesia. Differences in effect sizes are not only driven by the choice of conservation measures. One key lesson from the studies is the need to move beyond the current scientific focus of estimating average effects of undifferentiated conservation programs. The specific elements of the program design and the implementation context are equally important factors for understanding the effectiveness of conservation programs. Particularly critical will be a better understanding of the causal mechanisms through which conservation programs have impacts. To achieve this understanding we need advances in both theory and methods.},

This paper reviews global voluntary and involuntary strategies for private land conservation. Involuntary strategies can achieve effective conservation outcomes, but often lack social acceptability. In contrast, voluntary strategies enjoy greater social acceptance but may not achieve sufficient uptake to have meaningful conservation objectives. Based on the review, we propose a classification system for private land conservation as a complement to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN's) classification of global protected areas. The classification system provides a framework for identifying and describing conservation strategies on private land on the dimension of tenure and security. It also identifies opportunities and vulnerabilities in achieving conservation on private land while emphasising the need for systematic data collection similar to IUCN's efforts for protected areas.},

Our mailed survey to landowners with property enrolled in the Indiana Classified Forest and Wildlands Program in U.S.A. revealed that (1) environmental motives, (2) residential motives like family life, and (3) having more land enrolled in the program were strong predictors of individuals who implemented conservation actions such as removal of invasive species and control of erosion. We also found that landowners witnessing environmental improvements on their land reported more conservation actions than those perceiving unchanged environmental conditions.

This is especially the case in settings where the share of private ownership is large and the economic costs associated with land acquisition are high. We used probit regression analysis and historical participation data to examine the likelihood of participation of Danish forest owners in a voluntary conservation program. We used the results to spatially predict the likelihood of participation of all forest owners in Denmark. We merged spatial data on the presence of forest, cadastral information on participation contracts, and individual-level socioeconomic information about the forest owners and their households. We included predicted participation in a probability model for species survival. Uninformed and informed (included land owner characteristics) models were then incorporated into a spatial prioritization for conservation of unmanaged forests. The choice models are based on sociodemographic data on the entire population of Danish forest owners and historical data on their participation in conservation schemes. Inclusion in the model of information on private landowners’ willingness to supply land for conservation yielded at intermediate budget levels up to 30\% more expected species coverage than the uninformed prioritization scheme. Our landowner-choice model provides an example of moving toward more implementable conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Land use is regulated through various mixes of command-and-control interventions that directly affect land use via land use restrictions, and other public interventions that indirectly affect land use via agricultural, forestry, trade or macro-economic policies. More recently, coalitions of public and private actors have designed market-based and/or demand-led policy instruments to influence land use—e.g., eco-certification, geographical indications, commodity roundtables, moratoria, and payments for environmental services. These innovative instruments fall along a continuum of state involvement and interact with traditional public forms of land use regulation, leading to “hybrid” interventions. This article reviews emerging evidence on the effectiveness of the main instruments used to promote sustainable land use, and explores interactions between the new demand-led interventions and formal regulatory public policies. Although there are still insufficient rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of hybrid instruments, available evidence suggests some positive direct and indirect benefits. Hybrid instruments combine elements from both private and public regulatory systems, in innovative and effective ways. We propose a typology to characterize potential interactions between instruments that regulate land use. It links various types of interactions—i.e., complementarity, substitution, and antagonism—to the various stages of regulatory processes—i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and monitoring and enforcement. We give examples of governments endorsing certifications or using certification to support their own policies; governments creating enabling conditions for hybrid instruments to mature, allowing for wider adoption; and private instruments reinforcing public regulations or substituting for missing or weak governance. In some cases, governments, NGOs and corporations compete and may hinder each other's actions. With favourable institutional and governance contexts, well-designed hybrid public-private instruments can be effective. More systematic evaluation could boost the effectiveness of instruments and enhance synergistic interaction with traditional public land-use policy instruments to achieve incremental benefits as well as longer-term transformative outcomes in land-use protection.},

	doi = {10.1111/cobi.12046},
	abstract = {Two contrasting strategies have been proposed for conserving biological diversity while meeting the increasing demand for agricultural products: land sparing and land sharing production systems. Land sparing involves increasing yield to reduce the amount of land needed for agriculture, whereas land-sharing agricultural practices incorporate elements of native ecosystems into the production system itself. Although the conservation value of these systems has been extensively debated, empirical studies are lacking. We compared bird communities in shade coffee, a widely practiced land-sharing system in which shade trees are maintained within the coffee plantation, with bird communities in a novel, small-scale, land-sparing coffee-production system (integrated open canopy or IOC coffee) in which farmers obtain higher yields under little or no shade while conserving an area of forest equal to the area under cultivation. Species richness and diversity of forest-dependent birds were higher in the IOC coffee farms than in the shade coffee farms, and community composition was more similar between IOC coffee and primary forest than between shade coffee and primary forest. Our study represents the first empirical comparison of well-defined land sparing and land sharing production systems. Because IOC coffee farms can be established by allowing forest to regenerate on degraded land, widespread adoption of this system could lead to substantial increases in forest cover and carbon sequestration without compromising agricultural yield or threatening the livelihoods of traditional small farmers. However, we studied small farms ({\textless}5 ha); thus, our results may not generalize to large-scale land-sharing systems. Furthermore, rather than concluding that land sparing is generally superior to land sharing, we suggest that the optimal approach depends on the crop, local climate, and existing land-use patterns.},

	abstract = {Feeding a rapidly expanding human population will require a large increase in the supply of agricultural products during the coming decades. This may lead to the transformation of many landscapes from natural vegetation cover to agricultural land use, unless increases in crop yields reduce the need for new farmland. Here, we assess the evidence that past increases in agricultural yield have spared land for wild nature. We investigated the relationship between the change in the combined energy yield of the 23 most energetically important food crops over the period 1979–1999 and the change in per capita cropland area for 124 countries over the same period. Per capita area of the 23 staple crops tended to decrease in developing countries where large yield increases occurred. However, this was counteracted by a tendency for the area used to grow crops other than staples to increase in the countries where staple crop yields increased. There remained a weak tendency in developing countries for the per capita area of all cropland to decline as staple crop yield increased, a pattern that was most evident in developing countries with the highest per capita food supplies. In developed countries, there was no evidence that higher staple crop yields were associated with decreases in per capita cropland area. This may be because high agricultural subsidies in developed countries override any land-sparing pattern that might otherwise occur. Declines in the area of natural forest were smaller in countries where the yield of staple crops increased most, when the negative effects of human population increases on forest area were controlled for. Our results show that land-sparing is a weak process that occurs under a limited set of circumstances, but that it can have positive outcomes for the conservation of wild nature.},

Some think it best to retain as much wildlife as possible on farms, even at the cost of lowering yield (production per unit area). Others advocate the opposite: increasing yield so as to limit the area needed for farming, and then retaining larger areas under natural habitats. Still others support a mixture of the two extremes, or an intermediate approach. Here we summarize a model designed to resolve this disagreement, and review the empirical evidence available to date. We conclude that this evidence largely supports the second, so-called land-sparing approach to reconciling agriculture and biodiversity conservation, but that important questions remain over the generality of these ½ndings for different biota and for ecosystem services, how best to increase yields while limiting environmental externalities, and whether there are effective, socially just, and practical mechanisms for coupling yield growth to habitat retention and restoration.},

	abstract = {Certification systems (CS) set and monitor voluntary standards to make agricultural production sustainable in socio-economic terms and agricultural trade fairer for producers and workers. They try to achieve a wide range of socio-economic and environmental effects through bundles of interventions that include the process of standard setting and compliance, advocacy among consumers, capacity building for producers, building supply chains, price interventions, and the application of acceptable labour standards, overall to improve the wellbeing of farmers and agricultural workers. This paper presents the results of a mixed-method systematic review that synthesized the literature on socio-economic effects of certification systems on agricultural producers and wage workers in low and middle income countries. The review followed the Campbell Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews, and included studies published between 1990 and 2016 in different languages, with evidence on low and middle income countries. The review included a quantitative effectiveness question focused on a range of intermediate (e.g. prices, wages) and endpoint outcomes (e.g. household income). It also included a question on barriers, facilitators and contextual factors shaping effectiveness which drew on qualitative or mixed-method studies. Eligible certification systems were based on second- (industry-level) or third-party certifications, and excluded own-company standards. For the effectiveness review, quantitative impact evaluations must use experimental or non-experimental methods demonstrating control for selection bias. With these inclusion criteria, the review includes 43 studies used for analysing quantitative effects, and 136 qualitative studies for synthesizing barriers, enablers and other contextual factors. Most included studies report on initiatives in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa and focus primarily on agricultural producers. The quality of the included studies is mixed, and several studies are weak on a number of methodological fronts, especially on statistical reporting. Overall, there is limited and mixed evidence on the effects of CS on a range of intermediate and final socio-economic outcomes for agricultural producers and wage workers. There are positive effects on prices and income from the sale of produce is higher for certified farmers. However, workers' wages do not seem to benefit from the presence of CS and, further along the causal chain, we find no evidence that total household income improves with certification. The integrated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies shows that context matters substantially in all causal chains and multiple factors shape the effectiveness and causal mechanisms that link interventions associated with certification and the wellbeing of producers, workers and their families.},

Different methods and approaches are used to assess the effectiveness and impact of these certification schemes at farm-household, village, cooperative, and regional level. We provide an overview of the results from robust impact studies on coffee, tea, banana, cocoa, and cotton certification programmes. Overall outcomes show rather modest net revenue effects for farmers, small direct income effect for wage workers, and contested sustainability effects. Most impact studies focus on primary sourcing, but devote less attention to changes in trust and governance throughout the value chain. Moreover, implications for gender issues and supply chain trust are not always fully addressed. In order to better understand these somewhat disappointing effects, we discuss different fallacies and drawbacks that affect impact studies concerning commodity certification programmes. Main attention is given to perverse incentives for intensification and specialization that arise from certification. Moreover, spillovers to other (non-certified) farmers and spatial externalities at landscape level may reduce net effects. Important secondary effects related to behavioural change (risk, trust) and local innovation dynamics are usually overlooked. Current practices in value chain development programmes should focus increasingly on dynamic effects of upgrading and improved market integration. New interactive impact assessment approaches (gaming, multi-agency simulation) that address integrated value chain relationships offer promising perspectives for real-time and systematic analysis of alternatives for smallholder value chain inclusion beyond certification.},

	abstract = {As the demands on agricultural lands to produce food, fuel, and fiber continue to expand, effective strategies are urgently needed to balance biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. “Land sparing” and “wildlife-friendly farming” have been proposed as seemingly opposing strategies to achieve this balance. In land sparing, homogeneous areas of farmland are managed to maximize yields, while separate reserves target biodiversity conservation. Wildlife-friendly farming, in contrast, integrates conservation and production within more heterogeneous landscapes. Different scientific traditions underpin the two approaches. Land sparing is associated with an island model of modified landscapes, where islands of nature are seen as separate from human activities. This simple dichotomy makes land sparing easily compatible with optimization methods that attempt to allocate land uses in the most efficient way. In contrast, wildlife-friendly farming emphasizes heterogeneity, resilience, and ecological interactions between farmed and unfarmed areas. Both social and biophysical factors influence which approach is feasible or appropriate in a given landscape. Drawing upon the strengths of each approach, we outline broad policy guidelines for conservation in agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient often provisioning services such as crop production can increase without sacrificing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses Dense, Mixed and Seasonal forests and is a hotspot for biodiversity conservation, given its high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. Examining trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF can provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the three forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity, by improving local management practices. The three forest types show similar patterns in ES trade-offs, with differences within Mixed forest. Biodiversity is likely to be more sensitive to land-use change than are crop revenues: certain crops can yield up to ten times higher value in some sites. Enhanced management practices may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our simulations show how to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF. Achieving management outcomes that increase efficiency by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on 1) knowledge of forest type, 2) the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and 3) preserving species in a balanced manner across forests.

	abstract = {Insects play a key role in the regulation and dynamics of many ecosystem services (ES). However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes.},

	abstract = {Both the means by which we produce our food and our eating habits influence some of the most important environmental problems of our planet. The most exploited livestock for the past 50 years has been cattle, which are fed primarily on maize to increase production. However, this combination of maize and cattle is inefficient in ecological terms. Producing and consuming proteins from animals with more efficient biomass and energy conversions could help to solve certain environmental problems. For instance, insects that are considered pests in agricultural systems — including, specifically, the Orthoptera species — may be excellent candidates as protein sources. This work analyses the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the three types of livestock that are most widely bred worldwide: cattle, pigs, and poultry. It then compares these results with those of potential minilivestock from the Orthoptera species that are more abundant in agroecosystems. Based on the calculated FCRs (cow:pork:poultry:grasshopper pests and insects grown on farms; 10:6:2:4:1.7), we project that reducing beef production by half could significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and the maize sowing hectares destined for feed (2.1–2.9×107ha), while simultaneously releasing maize for human consumption. Additionally, consuming insect-based protein could reduce pollution problems by decreasing insecticide use (by at least 7×107l). Though a comprehensive solution to current environmental problems (e.g. global warming), will require coordinated global effort (e.g. to replace fossil fuels), there is one way that everyone can contribute: eating grasshopper burgers instead of beef burgers.},

	abstract = {Ecological restoration has received increasing attention as international agreements have set ambitious goals to mitigate environmental change and reshape degraded landscapes. However, current restoration activities sometimes remain modest in their success. In particular, tropical forest restoration has had mixed outcomes with variable cost-efficiency. Here, we address the need for taking into account the spatial context of restoration to inform policy initiatives that aim to improve the ecological and economic effectiveness of restoration. We accessed the spatial distribution of relevant characteristics for ecological restoration in an emblematic heavily degraded tropical region: São Paulo state, Brazil. We compared statewide patterns in soil erosion risk, distance to remnant habitat, and agricultural land use, to their characteristics in land voluntarily offered for active restoration. Based on this comparison, active restoration is likely to take place through small, low-priced parcels of land, usually in the context of substantial soil erosion risk and exacerbated deforestation. Restoration ecology predicts the need for expensive actions to assist a limited recovery process in such highly degraded conditions. This general pattern also suggests the necessity for long-term commitment among a broad set of social actors, combined to mitigation of degradation in adjacent remnants and agricultural lands. Active restoration may be complemented by spontaneous regeneration in areas with less adverse conditions. Policy makers therefore need to consider the complementarity of lands voluntarily offered for restoration, and land made available for restoration through other mechanisms. Our findings, likely applicable to other densely populated tropical regions, suggest that land-use policies need to address drivers of restoration success at a fine-scale to enable effective strategies. We suggest this can be achieved by spatial analyses that incorporate biophysical features that determine restoration opportunities and the likelihood of success.},

	abstract = {Agriculture as a source of food has a substantial spillover that affects the Earth's ecosystems. This results in an ‘ecological footprint’ of food: negative environmental impacts per capita. The footprint depends on the dietary choice of types and amounts of food, on the non-consumed part of product flows and its fate (‘waste’ or ‘reused’), on transport and processing along the value chain, on the environmental impacts of production per unit area, and on the area needed per unit product. Yield gaps indicate inefficiency in this last aspect: resource-use efficiency gaps for water and nutrients indicate that environmental impacts per unit area are higher than desirable. Ecological intensification aimed at simultaneously closing these two gaps requires process-level understanding and system-level quantification of current efficiency of the use of land and other production factors at multiple scales (field, farm, landscape, regional and global economy). Contrary to common opinion, yield and efficiency gaps are partially independent in the empirical evidence. Synergy in gap closure is possible in many contexts where efforts are made but are not automatic. With Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), enforceable in world trade to control hidden subsidies, there is scope for incremental improvement towards food systems that are efficient at global, yet sustainable at local, scales.},

	abstract = {Assuming ‘ceteris paribus’ in terms of the viability of the planet during the coming half-century or so, the rising needs of a burgeoning, but also increasingly rich and demanding world population will drastically change agriculture. Crop yields and animal productivity will have to increase substantially, with the risk of further depleting the resource base and degrading the environment, making food production both the culprit and the victim. Future food security therefore depends on development of technologies that increase the efficiency of resource use and prevent externalization of costs. The current trend is towards intensification, especially more output per production unit so as to increase input efficiency. Whether that trend is sustainable is a matter of strong debate among scientists and policy-makers alike. The big question is how to produce more food with much fewer resources. Sustainable intensification (i.e., increasing agricultural output while keeping the ecological footprint as small as possible) for some is an oxymoron, unless real progress can be made in ecological intensification, that is, increasing agricultural output by capitalizing on ecological processes in agro-ecosystems. Definitions of intensification and sustainability vary greatly. The way these concepts are being used in different disciplines causes tensions and hides trade-offs instead of making them explicit. Inter-disciplinarity and boundary-crossing in terminology and concepts are needed. Implicitly, the operationalization of intensification and sustainability implies appreciation of and choices for values, an issue that is often overlooked and sometimes even denied in the natural sciences. The multidimensional nature of intensification needs to be linked to the various notions of sustainability, acknowledging a hierarchy of considerations underlying decision-making on trade-offs, thus allowing political and moral arguments to play a proper role in the strategy towards sustainable intensification. We make a plea to create clarity in assumptions, norms and values in that decision-making process. Acknowledging that win-win situations are rare and that (some) choices have to be made on non-scientific grounds makes the debate more transparent and its outcome more acceptable both to the scientific community and society at large.},

	abstract = {The need to feed nine billion people in 2050 has given rise to widespread debate in science and policy circles. The debate is largely framed in neo-Malthusian terms, and elements of global food security (resilience of the food system, food quantity and quality, right to and access to food) demand equal attention. High-intensive agriculture, which enabled population growth and food for a large proportion of the global population, is often regarded as incompatible with current environmental (and social) sustainability. Because of the often problematic nature of high-intensive industrialized agriculture, sustainable agricultural intensification has been called an oxymoron. Pathways to sustainably intensify agriculture vary from business-as-usual to claims that a radical rethinking of our agricultural production is imperative. Three terms have been coined to differentiate such pathways. Whereas conventional intensification, that is business-as-usual, is uncontroversial (but often considered unlikely to be able to achieve environmental sustainability), the phrases sustainable intensification and ecological intensification both have a complex history. Although one could think that they have similar meanings, the phrases represent very different perspectives in discourses in science and policy circles. The terms Utopians and Arcadians are introduced for adherents of those perspectives. We observe that they both devote insufficient attention to inevitable trade-offs. Agricultural intensification in developing countries was greatly accelerated by the Green Revolution, which largely bypassed sub-Saharan Africa. Discontent with that outcome has led to a plethora of new terms to indicate more successful next steps for sub-Saharan agriculture. Industrialized agriculture as currently practised in developed countries will not provide a universal solution. This epilogue of the special issue and the literature herein show that intense debates on sustainable agricultural intensification are needed. Such debates on intensification demand reflection on the role of scientists with regard to their uses of current and the generation of novel knowledge.},

We use atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration as a single, simple indicator to track the progression of the Anthropocene. From a preindustrial value of 270-275 ppm, atmospheric carbon dioxide had risen to about 310 ppm by 1950. Since then the human enterprise has experienced a remarkable explosion, the Great Acceleration, with significant consequences for Earth System functioning. Atmospheric CO₂ concentration has risen from 310 to 380 ppm since 1950, with about half of the total rise since the preindustrial era occurring in just the last 30 years. The Great Acceleration is reaching criticality. Whatever unfolds, the next few decades will surely be a tipping point in the evolution of the Anthropocene.},

The criteria and approach we propose, for a paradigm shift towards sustainable intensification of agriculture, integrates the dual and interdependent goals of using sustainable practices to meet rising human needs while contributing to resilience and sustainability of landscapes, the biosphere, and the Earth system. Both of these, in turn, are required to sustain the future viability of agriculture. This paradigm shift aims at repositioning world agriculture from its current role as the world’s single largest driver of global environmental change, to becoming a key contributor of a global transition to a sustainable world within a safe operating space on Earth.},

	abstract = {Natural habitats adjacent to agricultural areas are often considered sources of species that provide beneficial regulating ecosystem services through cross-habitat spillover. Both inter-habitat matrix and landscape configuration can influence spillover by controlling organismal ability to disperse through landscapes, and affecting the provision of additional or supplementary resources that impact organism survival. To understand how landscape structure in terms of matrix land use type, forest cover and edge density might facilitate avian cross-habitat spillover, we sampled avian communities in forest patches and adjacent land use types (coffee plantations or cattle pastures) using a well-replicated study design across 92 sampling sites across a landscape-context forest cover gradient (6\%–60\%). Land use type was a key factor influencing avian cross-habitat spillover, facilitating species movement into coffee plantations and acting as a barrier to spillover into cattle pastures. We found that 24\% of the forest-dependent species pool was capable of spillover into coffee plantations, while spillover was nearly non-existent in cattle pastures. Forest cover was also the main driver of spillover into coffee plantations. There was a positive relationship between forest cover and spillover, potentially due to processes related with (1) a higher density of organism in-patches, (2) decreased isolation among patches facilitating species movement and (3) higher landscape supplementation processes. Finally, we found edge density had an additive effect with forest cover on spillover. Spillover was higher in high-forested landscapes with many forest-matrix edges, possibly due to increased structural connectivity for species able to move through edges, and to improved access for forest-dwelling species to different resource types (complementation processes). Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that land use type is a key factor facilitating species spillover into agricultural matrices and that the influence of land use type on spillover is further modulated by a combination of native habitat amount and edge density. These results should be considered in efforts to design or manage sustainable agricultural landscapes in order to enhance both bird persistence and the provision of bird-mediated ecosystem services.},

Matrix quality should influence the location of thresholds along habitat loss gradients through its effects on connectivity; however these relationships have seldom been explored empirically. Using field data from 23 independent 1254 ha landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we evaluated how tropical avian biodiversity responds to native forest loss within habitat patches embedded either in homogeneous pasture matrix context (with a high proportion of cattle pastures), and heterogeneous coffee matrix context (with high abundance of sun coffee plantations). We considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and tested if matrix type and choice of diversity metric influenced the location of biodiversity thresholds along the forest cover gradient. We found that matrix type postponed the abrupt loss of taxonomic diversity, from a threshold of 35\% of forest cover in homogeneous pasture matrix to 19\% in heterogeneous coffee matrix. Phylogenetic diversity responded similarly, with thresholds at 30 and 24\% in homogeneous-pasture and heterogeneous-coffee matrices, respectively, but no relationship with forest cover was detected when corrected for richness correlation. Despite the absence of a threshold for functional diversity in either matrix types, a strong decline below 20\% of habitat amount was detected. Finally, below 20\% native habitat loss, all diversity indices demonstrated abrupt declines, indicating that even higher-quality matrices cannot postpone diversity loss below this critical threshold. These results highlight that taxonomic diversity is a more sensitive index of biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes, which may be used as a benchmark to prevent subsequent functional and phylogenetic losses. Furthermore, increasing matrix quality appears an efficient conservation strategy to maintain higher biodiversity levels in fragmented landscapes over a larger range of habitat loss.},

Drawing on a team of more than one hundred authors and reviewers, this book demonstrates the value of ecosystems and biodiversity to the economy, society and individuals. It underlines the urgency of strategic policy making and action at national and international levels, and presents a rich evidence base of policies and instruments in use around the world and a wide range of innovative solutions. It highlights the need for new public policy to reflect the appreciation that public goods and social benefits are often overlooked and that we need a transition to decision making which integrates the many values of nature across policy sectors. It explores the range of instruments to reward those offering ecosystem service benefits, such as water provision and climate regulation. It looks at fiscal and regulatory instruments to reduce the incentives of those running down our natural capital, and at reforming subsidies such that they respond to current and future priorities. The authors also consider two major areas of investment in natural capital - protected areas and investment in restoration. Overall the book underlines the needs and ways to transform our approach to natural capital, and demonstrates how we can practically take into account the value of ecosystems and biodiversity in policy decisions - at national and international levels - to promote the protection of our environment and contribute to a sustainable economy and to the wellbeing of societies.},

Our study partitions land costs into three distinct opportunity costs to smallholder agriculture, soybean agriculture and ranching. We demonstrate that opportunity costs to single stakeholder groups can be inaccurate measures of true opportunity costs and can inadvertently shift conservation costs to affect groups of stakeholders disproportionately. Additionally, we examine how spatial correlations between costs as well as target size affect the performance of opportunity costs to single stakeholder groups as surrogate measures of true opportunity costs. We conclude that planning with opportunity costs to single stakeholder groups can result in cost burdens to other groups that could undermine the long-term success of conservation. Thus, an understanding of the spatial distributions of opportunity costs that are disaggregated to groups of stakeholders is necessary to make informed decisions about priority conservation areas.},

Despite this, applications to date have been limited, perhaps partly because of the difficulty in determining costs in regions with limited data on land prices and ownership. We present methods for estimating opportunity costs of land preservation in landscapes or ecoregions that are a changing mix of agriculture and natural habitat. Our approach derives from the literature on estimating land values as opportunity costs of alternate land uses and takes advantage of general availability of necessary data, even in relatively data-poor regions. The methods integrate probabilities of habitat conversion with region-wide estimates of economic benefits from agricultural land uses and estimate land values with a discount rate to convert annual values into net present values. We applied our method in a landscape undergoing agricultural conversion in Paraguay. Our model of opportunity costs predicted an independent data set of land values and was consistent with implicit discount rates of 15–25\%. Model-generated land values were strongly correlated with actual land values even after correcting for the effect of property size and proportion of property that was forested. We used the model to produce a map of opportunity costs and to estimate the costs of conserving forest within two proposed corridors in the landscape. This method can be applied to conservation planning in situations where natural habitat is currently being converted to market-oriented land uses. Incorporating not only biological attributes but also socioeconomic data can help in the design of efficient networks of protected areas that represent biodiversity at minimum costs.},

In human-dominated tropical landscapes, forest remnants may provide ecosystem services and act as a source for beneficial organisms immigrating into adjacent annual and perennial agro-ecosystems. In this study, we use empirical data on the negative effects of increasing forest distance on both pollinator diversity and fruit set of coffee to estimate future changes in pollination services for different land use scenarios in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Spatially explicit land use simulations demonstrate that depending on the magnitude and location of ongoing forest conversion, pollination services are expected to decline continuously and thus directly reduce coffee yields by up to 18\%, and net revenues per hectare up to 14\% within the next two decades (compared to average yields of the year 2001). Currently, forests in the study area annually provide pollination services worth 46 Euros per hectare. However, our simulations also revealed a potential win-win constellation, in which ecological and economic values can be preserved, if patches of forests (or other natural vegetation) are maintained in the agricultural landscape, which could be a viable near future option for local farmers and regional land use planners.},

Organic farming and plant diversification are farm management schemes that may mitigate potential ecological harm by increasing species richness and boosting related ecosystem services to agroecosystems. What remains unclear is the extent to which farm management schemes affect biodiversity components other than species richness, and whether impacts differ across spatial scales and landscape contexts. Using a global metadataset, we quantified the effects of organic farming and plant diversification on abundance, local diversity (communities within fields), and regional diversity (communities across fields) of arthropod pollinators, predators, herbivores, and detritivores. Both organic farming and higher in-field plant diversity enhanced arthropod abundance, particularly for rare taxa. This resulted in increased richness but decreased evenness. While these responses were stronger at local relative to regional scales, richness and abundance increased at both scales, and richness on farms embedded in complex relative to simple landscapes. Overall, both organic farming and in-field plant diversification exerted the strongest effects on pollinators and predators, suggesting these management schemes can facilitate ecosystem service providers without augmenting herbivore (pest) populations. Our results suggest that organic farming and plant diversification promote diverse arthropod metacommunities that may provide temporal and spatial stability of ecosystem service provisioning. Conserving diverse plant and arthropod communities in farming systems therefore requires sustainable practices that operate both within fields and across landscapes.},

	abstract = {Understanding how landscape characteristics affect biodiversity patterns and ecological processes at local and landscape scales is critical for mitigating effects of global environmental change. In this review, we use knowledge gained from human-modified landscapes to suggest eight hypotheses, which we hope will encourage more systematic research on the role of landscape composition and configuration in determining the structure of ecological communities, ecosystem functioning and services. We organize the eight hypotheses under four overarching themes. Section A: ‘landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns' includes (1) the landscape species pool hypothesis—the size of the landscape-wide species pool moderates local (alpha) biodiversity, and (2) the dominance of beta diversity hypothesis—landscape-moderated dissimilarity of local communities determines landscape-wide biodiversity and overrides negative local effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Section B: ‘landscape moderation of population dynamics' includes (3) the cross-habitat spillover hypothesis—landscape-moderated spillover of energy, resources and organisms across habitats, including between managed and natural ecosystems, influences landscape-wide community structure and associated processes and (4) the landscape-moderated concentration and dilution hypothesis—spatial and temporal changes in landscape composition can cause transient concentration or dilution of populations with functional consequences. Section C: ‘landscape moderation of functional trait selection’ includes (5) the landscape-moderated functional trait selection hypothesis—landscape moderation of species trait selection shapes the functional role and trajectory of community assembly, and (6) the landscape-moderated insurance hypothesis—landscape complexity provides spatial and temporal insurance, i.e. high resilience and stability of ecological processes in changing environments. Section D: ‘landscape constraints on conservation management' includes (7) the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis—landscape-moderated effectiveness of local conservation management is highest in structurally simple, rather than in cleared (i.e. extremely simplified) or in complex landscapes, and (8) the landscape-moderated biodiversity versus ecosystem service management hypothesis—landscape-moderated biodiversity conservation to optimize functional diversity and related ecosystem services will not protect endangered species. Shifting our research focus from local to landscape-moderated effects on biodiversity will be critical to developing solutions for future biodiversity and ecosystem service management.},

	abstract = {1 Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee, and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal conditions for pollinators. 2 We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee species. 3 The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest, whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms. 4 Fruit set of open pollinated flowers (as opposed to manually cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95\%) than a species-poor bee community of six species (70\% fruit set). 5 Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee assemblage. 6 Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee. This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage different species of bees through simple management measures such as growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems ({\textless} 500 m) so that forest-nesting social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the flowers.},

We examined the relative importance of insect, wind, and spontaneous self-pollination and the degree of self-fertility of these two coffee species in 24 agroforestry coffee fields in Indonesia. In both species, open pollination and cross pollination by hand led to the highest fruit set. Wind pollination (including self-pollination) led to 16\% lower fruit set than open pollination in C. canephora and to 12.3\% lower fruit set in C. arabica. Self-pollinated flowers and unmanipulated controls achieved an extremely low fruit set of 10\% or less in the self-sterile species, and of 60\% and 48\%, respectively in the self-fertile species. These results constitute experimental evidence that cross pollination by bees causes a significant increase in fruit set of not only the self-sterile, but also the self-fertile coffee species. The practical implication is that coffee yield may be improved by managing fields for increased flower visitation by bees.},

Various strategies to address this tension, such as payments for ecosystem services, wildlife-friendly farming, and conservation-reserve planning, emphasize different aspects of the system and different policy approaches. We argue that the strategic approach must be matched to the region. That is, land-use policy and research agendas focusing on improving agronomic and ecological functioning need to be coordinated, and informed by integrated knowledge about the ecological, agronomic and socio-economic characteristics of a region. We trial the use of agricultural-production and biodiversity-conservation possibility sets as an integrating framework. We find two benefits. First, the process of developing production possibility frontiers enables researchers from different disciplines to jointly identify and debate the critical types and scales of interactions among production and biodiversity where there exist opportunities for improving the system. Second, we demonstrate how the shape of the biodiversity-production trade-off frontier, and where existing landscapes sit in relation to it, can determine the effectiveness of a policy in achieving production and conservation goals. Production possibility frontiers therefore provide a simple, flexible tool for a critical trans-disciplinary appraisal of policy, and can guide the choice of more sophisticated approaches to managing agricultural landscapes.},

We test with meta-analysis whether the benefits of AEM for species richness and abundance of plants and animals are determined by the surrounding landscape context. Across all studies (109 observations for species richness and 114 observations for abundance), AEM significantly increased species richness and their abundance. More specifically, we test the hypothesis that AEM benefits species richness and abundance (i.e. increases the difference between fields with and without AEM) more in simple than in complex landscapes. In croplands, species richness but not abundance was significantly enhanced in simple but not in complex landscapes. In grasslands, AEM effectively enhanced species richness and abundance regardless of landscape context. Pollinators were significantly enhanced by AEM in simple but not in complex landscapes in both croplands and grasslands. Our results highlight that the one-size-fits-all approach of many agri-environmental programmes is not an efficient way of spending the limited funds available for biodiversity conservation on farmland. Therefore, we conclude that AEM should be adapted to landscape structure and the species groups at which they are targeted.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have spread rapidly across the globe in the last two decades, emerging as an important alternative to halt deforestation and biodiversity loss. The motivations of farmers to take part in PES programs, however, is still largely unknown. Most of the recent studies on the theme have investigated factors influencing participation but a few of them have looked at the factors explaining the minimum financial compensation that farmers would expect to receive to join PES. Particularly scarce are the studies aiming to understand the relationships between the minimum amount of money (MAM) that farmers would demand to get involved in PES programs for forest conservation and restoration and the impacts of such programs on PES additionality. We focused our study on the early stages of the PES program of the Chapecó Ecological Corridor, an important agricultural region that provides vital ecosystem services in Southern Brazil. One hundred farmers from 21 municipalities were interviewed. Data were tested using maximum likelihood and the model selection approach. Almost all farmers interviewed (94\%) manifested interested in taking part in a PES program focused on forest conservation, but only 48\% would like to get involved in a forest restoration program. PES program modality (100\%), farmers’ income (65\%) and educational level (54\%) were the most important variables influencing the minimum amount of money required by farmers to get involved. In average, the farmers would expect 35\% more for forest restoration (US\$ 185.56/ha) than for conservation (US\$ 116.53/ha) programs. In any case, however, the net increase of forest cover resulting from the PES program would be insignificant. Nevertheless, PES could provide some additionality by halting forest degradation and by helping to curb small-scale and illegal deforestation. The low interest in restoration activities may jeopardize the PES program goals and cause negative impact on the implementation of the National Forest Act in the region. To overcome this constraint, the PES program managers should work with the farmers to raise awareness about the relevance of forest restoration in a region with seasonal water shortages, high level of erosion and of water pollution.},

Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover. We conclude that payments for ecosystem services in the form of subsidies for agroecology practices are promising.},

As part of a 22-year-old, 80 ha ER project being carried out around a water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the city of Iracemápolis (population 19,700), in the mega-diversity Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil, we assessed local community perceptions of the tangible and intangible benefits expected to arise from this project. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 292 members of the local community to gauge perceptions of benefits arising from various cultural and provisioning ecosystem services (ESs; especially safe and clean drinking water) provided by the 80 ha forest restoration project. A striking 94\% of those interviewed wanted more ER projects in their community. Participants reported an appreciation for cultural ESs such as esthetic landscape improvement, tourism, recreation, as well as various religious, spiritual, and educational services. In addition, 87\% of interviewees believed that the restoration project improved the quality of their drinking water, and 63\% said they would agree to an increase in water tariffs if the proceeds were to be invested in more forest restoration. Judging from this study, investigation and subsequent communication of popular perceptions of the various benefits of ER projects could promote consensus-building and support for projects among stakeholders, and inform governmental and societal investments in restoration.},

A crucial challenge for voluntary approaches is however to ensure private landowner involvement and get the ecosystem services delivered where they are most demanded by society. To promote participation and ensure an instrumental design of voluntary initiatives that is coherent with this, there is a need to understand the motivations of the landowners and determinants of their participation choice. We investigate landowners’ willingness to participate in protecting oak scrub sites in Denmark. Combining contract data of the landowners’ actual choices, GIS information on area specific characteristics and detailed individual level register data, we develop and implement a framework for analysing revealed choice of private landowners’ in voluntary conservation programs. We find that both the physical characteristics of the property and the sociodemographic characteristics of landowner in question matter, along with the information flow provided from the regulator. Results provide impetus into the design of future conservation policies, in terms of how, to whom and where to target efforts.},

Willingness to participate is typically examined via stated preference surveys using the standard hurdle model for whether and how much to participate. Among respondents who decline to participate, such analyses cannot distinguish between respondents who declined due to the payment level and those who were not interested at all. This paper applies a double hurdle model to incorporate a prior condition for whether a respondent is even willing to consider participating in the PES market. The model uses a unique stated preference survey permitting separation of the consideration and enrolment decisions of 1,700 farmers in Michigan, USA. The first hurdle probit model suggests that farmers’ willingness to consider PES chiefly depends on farm and farmer characteristics, while the second hurdle tobit model shows that decisions on whether and how much to enrol depend more on the payment offer and marginal benefit–cost criteria. This study provides fresh insights on facilitating farmer participation in PES programmes using tiered strategies that differ in costs of programme payment and administration.},

A range of empirical studies that explored factors influencing farmers’ willingness to participate in such schemes were selected and systematically analysed. The meta-analysis reveals several key drivers for participation in AESs including fair payments, lower household dependency on agricultural incomes, age and education levels, the presence of a successor and the ability to make progressive rather than step changes to agricultural activities. Of particular importance is the finding that the design of agri-environmental policy is not the only relevant factor influencing uptake but other policies which impact on the farm household and the rural community can also encourage or discourage participation in an AES.},

These characteristics include age, gender, education, level of off-farm income, farm size, proportion of remnant native vegetation on-farm, and ecological value of native vegetation on-farm. A sample of landholders who own greater than 2 ha of land in the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin region were sent a mail-based survey about their values and preferences for environmental management (N = 659, 52\% response). Cross-tabulations and ANOVA statistical analysis techniques were used to compare the socio-economic attributes across three landholder classes: disengaged, moderately engaged, and highly engaged in native vegetation planting. Results indicate that highly engaged landholders were more likely to be female, formally educated, hobby farmers who managed small parcels of land and have high off-farm incomes, whereas disengaged landholders held significantly stronger farming connections (more farming experience, family have lived on the farm for more generations). Spatial analysis revealed area-specific differences in conservation opportunity and conservation priority. In some areas, properties of high ecological value were managed by highly engaged landholders, but nearby properties of high value were managed by moderately engaged or disengaged landholders. Environmental managers therefore cannot assume areas of high conservation priority will be areas of high conservation opportunity. At the regional scale, the potential for revegetation seems most promising within the moderately engaged landholder group considering the vast amount of land managed by this group in areas of high ecological value, particularly within the less represented Mallee and Coorong and Rangelands sub-regions. We suggest that incentive schemes which purchase conservation need to be targeted at disengaged landholders; mentoring schemes led by commercial farmers highly engaged in native vegetation planting should be directed at moderately engaged landholders, and; awards programs which acknowledge conservation successes should be targeted at highly engaged landholders.},

Landscape value mapping and analysis of the stakeholders and conflicts between them were employed, as were statistical analysis of the linkages between the perceived benefits of the landscape and land use/land cover characteristics. Stakeholder analysis showed that the governmental institutions have more decision-making power than user group of the wetlands. Drainage control, over grazing, abstraction of sand-gravel from the river bed, environmental pollution and the lack of will to use the available legislative and administrative mechanisms are the primary factors that threaten the Ekşisu Wetlands and its multifunctionality. Among the landscape values examined, future value was considered the most important by the stakeholders. Two sets of landscape service bundles were identified; use and non-use landscape values; option landscape values- that are linked to Ekşisu Wetlands. Conflict between the nature conservation and agriculture sectors and, conflict between the stakeholders over provisioning, regulatory, and cultural services are two primary conflict issues that were identified in the drainage basin of the wetlands. Habitat protection and improvement, and protecting and improving the area’s regulating and cultural functions were proposed as priorities for the collaborative management of the area.},

	abstract = {An empirical model of landowners’ conservation incentive program choice is developed in which information about landowners’ socio-economic and property characteristics and their attitudes, is combined with incentive program attributes. In a Choice survey landowners were presented with the choice of two incentive programs modelled as ‘bundles of attributes’ mimicking a voluntary choice scenario. Landowner behaviour and decision and the type of conditions and regulations they preferred were analyzed. Based on choice survey data, landowner heterogeneity was accounted for using a latent class approach to estimate the preference parameters. Three latent classes of landowners with different attitudes to the role and outcome of establishing conservation reserves on private land were identified: multi-objective owners; environment owners; and production owners. Only a small proportion of landowners, mostly environment owners, would voluntarily join a program. Although compensation funding contributed to voluntary program choice for multi-objective owners and environment owners, welfare losses were around 4000 AUD per hectare, which is less than the average agricultural land value in Tasmania. Landowners for whom compensation funding contributed to voluntary program choice were also most likely to set aside land for conservation without payment. This raises the possibility that the government’s compensation expenditure could potentially be either reduced or re-allocated to landowners who will not voluntarily take conservation action. Increasing participation in conservation incentive programs and minimizing the welfare losses associated with meeting conservation targets may be best achieved by offering programs that allow flexibility in terms of legal arrangements and other program attributes.},

While we know much about what motivates landowners to participate as providers, or sellers, of conservation schemes, understanding what motivates landowners who act as buyers, that is, those who require land to meet conservation obligations, remains lacking. Here we identify viewpoints of sellers and buyers of an emerging forest certificate trading scheme in Brazil and quantify the compatibility of their views to examine potential barriers to trade. Sellers and buyers could be divided into three groups, but only one group in each case was positive about participating in the scheme. A key concern of buyers was the desire for establishing contracts with a long duration; in contrast, price was a key issue for sellers. Addressing these concerns by defining minimum contract lengths and restricting the spatial scale of transactions will be essential if this scheme is to realise its potential to reduce rates of deforestation.},

Low-intensity agricultural practices, however, may not sacrifice yields if they support biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. We quantified the value native predators provide to farmers by consuming coffee's most damaging insect pest, the coffee berry borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei). Our experiments in Costa Rica showed birds reduced infestation by 50\%, bats played a marginal role, and farmland forest cover increased pest removal. We identified borer-consuming bird species by assaying faeces for borer DNA and found higher borer-predator abundances on more forested plantations. Our coarse estimate is that forest patches doubled pest control over 230 km2 by providing habitat for 55 000 borer-consuming birds. These pest-control services prevented US\$75–US\$310 ha-year−1 in damage, a benefit per plantation on par with the average annual income of a Costa Rican citizen. Retaining forest and accounting for pest control demonstrates a win–win for biodiversity and coffee farmers.},

Predators and their prey form complex interaction networks, in which predators consume not only herbivores but also other predators. Resolving these interactions will be essential for predicting changes in many important ecosystem functions, such as the control of damaging crop pests. Here, we examine how birds, bats, and arthropods interact to determine herbivorous arthropod abundance and leaf damage in Costa Rican coffee plantations. In an exclosure experiment, we found that birds and bats reduced non?flying arthropod abundance by ?35\% and ?25\%, respectively. In contrast, birds and bats increased the abundance of flying arthropods, probably by consuming spiders. The frequency of this intraguild predation differed between birds and bats, with cascading consequences for coffee shrubs. Excluding birds caused a greater increase in herbivorous arthropod abundance than excluding bats, leading to increased coffee leaf damage. Excluding bats caused an increase in spiders and other predatory arthropods, increasing the ratio of predators to herbivores in the arthropod community. Bats, therefore, did not provide benefits to coffee plants. Leaf damage on coffee was low, and probably did not affect coffee yields. Bird?mediated control of herbivores, however, may aid coffee shrubs in the long term by preventing pest outbreaks. Regardless, our results demonstrate how complex, cascading interactions between predators and herbivores may impact plants and people.},

We investigated pest reduction services by insectivorous birds on a coffee farm in Jamaica, West Indies. Our results suggest that birds reduced insect pests on our study site. Infestation by the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei, the world's most damaging insect pest in coffee, was significantly elevated on coffee shrubs from which birds were experimentally excluded from foraging. Overall, we estimated the economic value of the reduction of coffee berry borer by birds on the 18?ha farm to be US\$310?ha?1 for the 2006 harvest season. These results provide additional evidence that birds can reduce numbers of economically damaging pests and enhance crop yields in coffee farms. Differences in the magnitude of pest reduction within the farm may have resulted from variation in shade management and surrounding habitats, and these factors merit further investigation.},

	abstract = {Wild animals substantially support crop production by providing ecosystem services, such as pollination and natural pest control. However, the strengths of synergies between ecosystem services and their dependencies on land-use management are largely unknown. Here, we took an experimental approach to test the impact of land-use intensification on both individual and combined pollination and pest control services in coffee production systems at Mount Kilimanjaro. We established a full-factorial pollinator and vertebrate exclosure experiment along a land-use gradient from traditional homegardens (agroforestry systems), shaded coffee plantations to sun coffee plantations (total sample size = 180 coffee bushes). The exclusion of vertebrates led to a reduction in fruit set of ca 9\%. Pollinators did not affect fruit set, but significantly increased fruit weight of coffee by an average of 7.4\%. We found no significant decline of these ecosystem services along the land-use gradient. Pest control and pollination service were thus complementary, contributing to coffee production by affecting the quantity and quality of a major tropical cash crop across different coffee production systems at Mount Kilimanjaro.},

However, no quantitative synthesis of this literature beyond simple vote-count methods yet exists. We conducted a meta-analysis of 46 landscape-level studies, and found that natural enemies have a strong positive response to landscape complexity. Generalist enemies show consistent positive responses to landscape complexity across all scales measured, while specialist enemies respond more strongly to landscape complexity at smaller scales. Generalist enemy response to natural habitat also tends to occur at larger spatial scales than for specialist enemies, suggesting that land management strategies to enhance natural pest control should differ depending on whether the dominant enemies are generalists or specialists. The positive response of natural enemies does not necessarily translate into pest control, since pest abundances show no significant response to landscape complexity. Very few landscape-scale studies have estimated enemy impact on pest populations, however, limiting our understanding of the effects of landscape on pest control. We suggest focusing future research efforts on measuring population dynamics rather than static counts to better characterise the relationship between landscape complexity and pest control services from natural enemies.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification has resulted in a simplification of agricultural landscapes by the expansion of agricultural land, enlargement of field size and removal of non-crop habitat. These changes are considered to be an important cause of the rapid decline in farmland biodiversity, with the remaining biodiversity concentrated in field edges and non-crop habitats. The simplification of landscape composition and the decline of biodiversity may affect the functioning of natural pest control because non-crop habitats provide requisites for a broad spectrum of natural enemies, and the exchange of natural enemies between crop and non-crop habitats is likely to be diminished in landscapes dominated by arable cropland. In this review, we test the hypothesis that natural pest control is enhanced in complex patchy landscapes with a high proportion of non-crop habitats as compared to simple large-scale landscapes with little associated non-crop habitat. In 74\% and 45\% of the studies reviewed, respectively, natural enemy populations were higher and pest pressure lower in complex landscapes versus simple landscapes. Landscape-driven pest suppression may result in lower crop injury, although this has rarely been documented. Enhanced natural enemy activity was associated with herbaceous habitats in 80\% of the cases (e.g. fallows, field margins), and somewhat less often with wooded habitats (71\%) and landscape patchiness (70\%). The similar contributions of these landscape factors suggest that all are equally important in enhancing natural enemy populations. We conclude that diversified landscapes hold most potential for the conservation of biodiversity and sustaining the pest control function.},

Although shade coffee farms can potentially support native pollinator communities, the degree to which these pollinators facilitate gene flow for native trees is unknown. We examined the role of native bees as vectors of gene flow for a reproductively specialized native tree, Miconia affinis, in a shade coffee and remnant forest landscape mosaic. We demonstrate extensive cross-habitat gene flow by native bees, with pollination events spanning more than 1,800 m. Pollen was carried twice as far within shade coffee habitat as in nearby forest, and trees growing within shade coffee farms received pollen from a far greater number of sires than trees within remnant forest. The study shows that shade coffee habitats support specialized native pollinators that enhance the fecundity and genetic diversity of remnant native trees.},

Landscape changes cause spatial and temporal bee community changes, but consequences how the community changes affect pollination is not well analyzed. This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination. The study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and coffee pollination. Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and 60\% per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500m isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit set per agro-forest. In conclusion, crops grown near intact rainforests and which profit from the pollination by many species may fluctuate less in bee-pollinated fruit set across crop plants than crop plants in isolated agriculture that receive low or even single species pollination services.},

Our focus is on tropical plantation crops, mainly coffee and cacao, and their pollinators, which are of basic ecological interest as partners in an important mutualistic interaction. We review how insect?mediated pollination services depend on local agroforest and natural habitats in surrounding landscapes. Further, we evaluate the functional significance of pollinator diversity and the explanatory value of species traits, and we provide an intercontinental comparison of pollinator assemblages. We found that optimal pollination success might be best understood as a consequence of niche complementarities among pollinators in landscapes harboring various species. We further show that small cavity?nesting bees and small generalist beetles were especially affected by isolation from forest and that larger?bodied insects in the same landscapes were not similarly affected. We suggest that mixed tropical landscapes with agroforestry systems have great potential for future research on the interactions between plants and pollinators.},

	abstract = {Science has shown the importance of animal pollinators to human food security, economy, and biodiversity conservation. Science continues to identify various factors causing pollinator declines and their implications. However, translation of the understanding of pollinators’ roles into current policy and regulation is weak and requires attention, both in developed and developing nations. The national and international trade of commodities generated via insect pollination is large. Trade in those crops could be a means of influencing regulations to promote the local existence of pollinating species, apart from their contributions to biodiversity conservation. This paper, using the example of international coffee production, reviews the value of pollinating species, and relates them to simple economics of commodity production. Recommendations are made that could influence policy and decision-making to promote coffee production, trade, and pollinators’ existence. Assumptions and considerations are raised and addressed. Although the role of insect pollinators in promoting fruit set and quality is accepted, implementing pollination conservation in forest habitats may require assured higher prices for coffee, and direct subsidies for forest conservation to prevent conversion to other crop lands. Exporting and importing governments and trade organizations could establish policy that requires insect pollination in the coffee certification process. The European Parliament and the North American Free Trade Agreement could be instrumental in creating policy and regulation that promotes insect pollination services in coffee production. The reciprocity between the services of insect pollinators in certified coffee production and their services in forest biodiversity production should be implicit in future policy negotiations to enhance both systems.},

Here, we show that fruit set of the self-fertilizing highland coffee (Coffea arabica) is highly variable and related to bee pollination. In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number of flower-visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60\% (three species) to 90\% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species-rich bee community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild-specific nesting requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as pollination and biodiversity. Conservation of rainforest adjacent to adequately managed agroforestry systems could improve the yields of farmers.},

We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 \%), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R2 = 0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U\$ 15.1 million (U\$ 419 k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest restoration.},

Here we evaluate the interactions among biotic pest regulation, pollination, and nutrient cycling. We found only 16 studies providing 20 analyses of two-way interactions. These studies show that multiple services limit crop yield simultaneously. Complementary eﬀects (no interactions) between ecosystem services were the most common, followed by synergistic eﬀects (positive interactions), while evidence for negative interactions was weak. Most studies evaluated two levels of service delivery, thus did not quantify the functional response of crop yield. Although this function is expected to be non-linear, most studies assume linear relations. We conclude that the lack of evidence for negative interactions has important implications for agricultural management.},

	abstract = {Wild bees are highly valuable pollinators. Along with managed honey bees, they provide a critical ecosystem service by ensuring stable pollination to agriculture and wild plant communities. Increasing concern about the welfare of both wild and managed pollinators, however, has prompted recent calls for national evaluation and action. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we assess the status and trends of wild bees and their potential impacts on pollination services across the coterminous United States. We use a spatial habitat model, national land-cover data, and carefully quantified expert knowledge to estimate wild bee abundance and associated uncertainty. Between 2008 and 2013, modeled bee abundance declined across 23\% of US land area. This decline was generally associated with conversion of natural habitats to row crops. We identify 139 counties where low bee abundances correspond to large areas of pollinator-dependent crops. These areas of mismatch between supply (wild bee abundance) and demand (cultivated area) for pollination comprise 39\% of the pollinator-dependent crop area in the United States. Further, we find that the crops most highly dependent on pollinators tend to experience more severe mismatches between declining supply and increasing demand. These trends, should they continue, may increase costs for US farmers and may even destabilize crop production over time. National assessments such as this can help focus both scientific and political efforts to understand and sustain wild bees. As new information becomes available, repeated assessments can update findings, revise priorities, and track progress toward sustainable management of our nation’s pollinators.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

Growing evidence suggests that ecological intensification of mainstream farming can safeguard food production, with accompanying environmental benefits; however, the approach is rarely adopted by farmers. Our review of the evidence for replacing external inputs with ecosystem services shows that scientists tend to focus on processes (e.g., pollination) rather than outcomes (e.g., profits), and express benefits at spatio-temporal scales that are not always relevant to farmers. This results in mismatches in perceived benefits of ecological intensification between scientists and farmers, which hinders its uptake. We provide recommendations for overcoming these mismatches and highlight important additional factors driving uptake of nature-based management practices, such as social acceptability of farming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Complementarity is one common explanation for these positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. Yet, complementarity is often indirectly quantified as overperformance in mixture relative to monoculture (e.g., ‘complementarity effect'). This overperformance is then attributed to the intuitive idea of complementarity or, more specifically, to species resource partitioning. Locally, however, several unassociated causes may drive this overperformance. Here, we differentiate complementarity into three types of species differences that may cause enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse ecosystems: (i) resource partitioning, (ii) abiotic facilitation, and (iii) biotic feedbacks. We argue that disentangling these three causes is crucial for predicting the response of ecosystems to future biodiversity loss.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species’ distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {[1. A new method for estimating the geographical distribution of plant and animal species from incomplete field survey data is developed. 2. Wildlife surveys are often conducted by dividing a study region into a regular grid and collecting data on abundance or on presence/absence from some or all of the squares in the grid. Generalized linear models (GLMs) can be used to model the spatial distribution of a species within such a grid by relating the response variable (abundance or presence/absence) to spatially referenced covariates. 3. Such models ignore or at best indirectly model dependence on unmeasured covariates, and the intrinsic spatial autocorrelation arising for example in gregarious populations. 4. We describe a procedure for use with presence/absence data in which spatial autocorrelation is modelled explicitly. We achieve this by extending a logistic model to include an extra covariate which is derived from the responses at neighbouring squares. The extended model is known as an autologistic model. 5. To allow fitting of the autologistic model when only a random sample of squares is surveyed, we use the Gibbs sampler to predict presence/absence at unsurveyed squares. 6. We compare the autologistic model with the ordinary logistic model using red deer census data. Both models are fitted to a subsample of 20\% of the data and results are compared with the 'true' abundance and spatial distribution indicated by the full census. We conclude that the autologistic model is superior for estimating the spatial distribution of the deer, whereas the ordinary logistic model yields more precise estimates of the overall number of squares occupied by deer at the time of the survey.]},

	abstract = {Among the important alternatives for land conservation is the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2015. This paper explores how landowners decide on alternative landuse choices made available by the expiration of CRP contracts in Kansas. The study uses survey data and multinomial Logit models to predict land-use choices. Two models were tested. The ﬁrst model does not incorporate variables concerning farmer perceptions and attitudes about land-use choices, while the second model does. The results show that CRP re-enrollment depends on factors, such as years of experience in cropping and percent of cropland irrigated. However, when perception variables are added, the models become more robust in explaining other land choice alternatives. The results suggest that as the perception of unfairness of more inﬂexible environmental policy rises, these farmers may be more likely to re-enroll their marginal land in the CRP program.},

Using a survey of 4,795 household-plots in rural Ethiopia, the study demonstrates the inappropriateness of pooling different forms of land conservation investments in preference studies. The results suggest that poverty drives farm-households towards conservation measures which are more short term and which entail the expenditure of less skill. While tenure security has a mixed effect on such preferences, market access seems not to matter for preference decisions. Further, farm-households consider the characteristics of the plot in their preference, which also vary across villages. This study shows that a farm-household's preference is a complex decision. Major changes in conservation investments on the part of farm-households will require attention to many factors, since no single factor exerts enough control to be used solitarily as a major policy leverage instrument.},

It seeks to facilitate the integration of ecosystem services into current practice, including landscape metrics as suitable indicators.MethodsA literature review supported the revision of existing open questions pertaining to ecosystem services as well as their integration into landscape ecology and spatial planning. A posterior reflection of the current state-of-the-art was then used as a basis for developing the spatial planning conceptual framework.Results and conclusionThe framework is articulated around four phases (characterisation, assessment, design, and monitoring) and three concepts (character, service, and value). It advocates integration of public participation, consideration of “landscape services”, the inclusion of ecosystem disservices, and the use of landscape metrics for qualitative assessment of services. As a result, the framework looks to enhance spatial planning practice by providing: (i) a better consideration of landscape configuration in the supply of services (ii) the integration of anthropogenic services with ecosystem services; (iii) the consideration of costs derived from ecosystems (e.g. disservices); and (iv) an aid to the understanding of ecosystem services terminology for spatial planning professionals and decision makers.},

	abstract = {The 2012 revision of the Brazilian Forest Act changed the relative importance of private and public governance for nature conservation and agricultural production. We present a spatially explicit land-use model for Brazilian agricultural production and nature conservation that considers the spatial distribution of agricultural land suitability, technological and management options, legal command, and control frameworks including the Atlantic Forest Law, the revised Forest Act, and the Amazonian land-titling, “Terra Legal,” and also market-driven land use regulations. The model is used to analyze land use allocation under three scenarios with varying priorities among agricultural production and environmental protection objectives. In all scenarios, the legal command and control frameworks were the most important determinants of conservation outcomes, protecting at least 80\% of the existing natural vegetation. Situations where such frameworks are not expected to be eﬀective can be identiﬁed and targeted for additional conservation (beyond legal requirements) through voluntary actions or self-regulation in response to markets. All scenarios allow for a substantial increase in crop production, using an area 1.5−2.7 times the current cropland area, with much of new cropland occurring on current pastureland. Current public arrangements that promote conservation can, in conjunction with voluntary schemes on private lands where conversion to agriculture is favored, provide important additional nature conservation without conﬂicting with national agricultural production objectives.},

We compared the connectivity increase resulting from (i) the simulated restoration of existing priority corridors, i.e., those with significant presence of forest but in which restoration actions would still result in considerable connectivity gains, or (ii) the simulated plantation of 30 hedgerows along new priority pathways, i.e., those areas with no current forest cover in which habitat creation would be more beneficial for connectivity.ResultsImplementing new priority pathways resulted in substantially larger connectivity gains (+ 38\%) than when restoration efforts were concentrated in improving already existing corridors (+ 11\%).ConclusionsEstablishing hedgerows along new pathways allowed enhancing the complementary and functionality of the full set of landscape corridors and proved more efficient than just strengthening the areas where dispersal flows were already concentrated. We demonstrated the importance of analytical procedures able to compare the effectiveness of different management strategies for enhancing connectivity. Our approach may be applied to multiple species sensitive to fragmentation in other heterogeneous landscapes and geographical contexts.},

	abstract = {Neutral landscape models (NLMs) simulate landscape patterns based on theoretical distributions and can be used to systematically study the effect of landscape structure on ecological processes. NLMs are commonly used in landscape ecology to enhance the findings of field studies as well as in simulation studies to provide an underlying landscape. However, their creation so far has been limited to software that is platform dependent, does not allow a reproducible workflow or is not embedded in R, the prevailing programming language used by ecologists. Here, we present two complementary R packages NLMR and landscapetools, that allow users to generate and manipulate NLMs in a single environment. They grant the simulation of the widest collection of NLMs found in any single piece of software thus far while allowing for easy manipulation in a self-contained and reproducible workflow. The combination of both packages should stimulate a wider usage of NLMs in ecology. NLMR is a comprehensive collection of algorithms with which to simulate NLMs. landscapetools provides a utility toolbox which facilitates an easy workflow with simulated neutral landscapes and other raster data. We show two example applications that illustrate potential use cases for NLMR and landscapetools: First, an agent-based simulation study in which the effect of spatial structure on disease persistence was studied. The second example shows how increases in spatial scaling can introduce biases in calculated landscape metrics. Simplifying the workflow around generating and handling NLMs should encourage an uptake in the usage of NLMs. NLMR and landscapetools are both generic frameworks that can be used in a variety of applications and are a further step to having a unified simulation environment in R for answering spatial research questions.},

We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9\%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4\%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other regions.},

Here we use field- and remote-sensing data to examine the effects of private landholding size on the amount and type of forest cover retained within economically active rural properties in an aging southern Amazonian deforestation frontier. Data on both upland and riparian forest cover from a survey of 300 rural properties indicated that 49.4\% (SD=29.0\%) of the total forest cover was maintained as of 2007, and that property size is a key regional-scale determinant of patterns of deforestation and land-use change. Small properties (≤150ha) retained a lower proportion of forest (20.7\%, SD=17.6) than did large properties ({\textgreater}150ha; 55.6\%, SD=27.2). Generalized linear models showed that property size had a positive effect on remaining areas of both upland and total forest cover. Using a Landsat time-series, the age of first clear-cutting that could be mapped within the boundaries of each property had a negative effect on the proportion of upland, riparian, and total forest cover retained. Based on these data, we show contrasts in land-use strategies between smallholders and largeholders, as well as differences in compliance with legal requirements in relation to minimum forest cover set-asides within private landholdings. This suggests that property size structure must be explicitly considered in landscape-scale conservation planning initiatives guiding agro-pastoral frontier expansion into remaining areas of tropical forest.},

Extensive simulation and empirical studies proved that these functions can readily handle sample sizes with as many as several millions of observations, provided the spatial weight matrix is in convenient sparse form, as is typically the case for large data sets, where each observation neighbours only a few other observations.},

	abstract = {Land use decisions result from complex deliberative processes and fundamentally influence the livelihoods of many. These decisions are made based on quantitatively measurable information like topography and on qualitative criteria such as personal preferences. Bayesian networks (BN) are able to integrate both quantitative and qualitative data and are thus suitable to approach such processes. We model land use decisions in a pre-Alpine area in Switzerland, integrating biophysical data and local actors' knowledge into a spatially explicit BN. A structured experts' process to elaborate three different BN including agriculture, forestry, and settlement provides the base for the modeling. A spatially explicit updating of the BN via questionnaires enables us to take local actors' characteristics into account. Results show which drivers are most important for land use decision-making in our case study region, and how an alteration of these drivers could change future land use. Furthermore, focusing on the probability of occurrence of various land uses in a spatially explicit manner gives insights into path-dependency of land use change. This knowledge can serve as information for planners and policy makers to design more effective policy instruments.},

	abstract = {Establishing cause–effect relationships for deforestation at various scales has proven difficult even when rates of deforestation appear well documented. There is a need for better explanatory models, which also provide insight into the process of deforestation. We propose a novel hierarchical modeling specification incorporating spatial association. The hierarchical aspect allows us to accommodate misalignment between the land-use (response) data layer and explanatory data layers. Spatial structure seems appropriate due to the inherently spatial nature of land use and data layers explaining land use. Typically, there will be missing values or holes in the response data. To accommodate this we propose an imputation strategy. We apply our modeling approach to develop a novel deforestation model for the eastern wet forested zone of Madagascar, a global rain forest “hot spot”. Using five data layers created for this region, we fit a suitable spatial hierarchical model. Though fitting such models is computationally much more demanding than fitting more standard models, we show that the resulting interpretation is much richer. Also, we employ a model choice criterion to argue that our fully Bayesian model performs better than simpler ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques to study deforestation processes. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and an indication of the broader ecological applicability of our modeling style.},

We advocate a new integrated research paradigm that explicitly recognizes cost-benefit trade-offs among animal activities and acknowledges that these activities occur within social-ecological contexts. Support for this paradigm is presented in an evidence-based conceptual model structured around five evidence statements highlighting emerging trends applicable to sustainable agriculture. The full range of benefits and costs associated with animal activities in agroecosystems cannot be quantified by focusing on single species groups, crops, or systems. Management of productive agroecosystems should sustain cycles of ecological interactions between crops and wild animals, not isolate these cycles from the system. Advancing this paradigm will therefore require integrated studies that determine net returns of animal activity in agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {Landscape context is a strong predictor of species persistence, abundance and distribution, yet its influence on the success of ecological restoration remains unclear. Thus, a primary question arises: which landscape size best predicts the effects of forest cover on restoration success? To answer this question, we conducted a global meta-analysis for biodiversity (mammals, birds, invertebrates, herpetofauna and plants) and measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, height, biomass and litter). Response ratios were calculated for comparisons between reference (e.g. old-growth forest) and disturbed sites (degraded or restored). Using an information-theoretic approach, mean response ratio (restoration success) and response ratio variance (restoration predictability) within each study landscape were regressed against the percentage of overall (summed forest cover) and contiguous (summed pixels of ≥60\% forest cover) forest within eight different buffer sizes of radius 5–200 km (at 1-km resolution). We included 247 studies encompassing 196 study landscapes and 4360 quantitative comparisons. The best buffer (landscape) size varied for the following: (i) overall and contiguous forest cover, (ii) biodiversity and vegetation structure and (iii) mean response ratio and response ratio variance. Only plant biodiversity was influenced by overall forest cover (buffer size of 5, 10 and 200 km radii), while plants (10 and 200 km radii), mammals (5, 10 and 50–200 km radii), invertebrates (5 and 10 km radii), cover (5 km radii), height (5 km radii) and litter (100 km radii) were influenced by contiguous forest cover. Overall, mean response ratio and response ratio variance were positively and negatively nonlinearly related with both overall and contiguous forest cover, respectively. We reveal for the first time a clear pattern of increasing restoration success and decreasing uncertainty as contiguous forest cover increases. We also indicate preliminary recommended buffer sizes for investigating landscape restoration effects on biodiversity and vegetation structure. However, the coarse grain and variability in the data mean the optimal landscape size may not have been detected; thus, further research is needed. Synthesis and applications. When setting targets for ecological restoration, policymakers and restoration practitioners should account for the following: (i) the landscape context, particularly the amount of contiguous habitat up to 10 km around a disturbed site, and (ii) the uncertainty in restoration success, as it increases when contiguous forest cover falls below about 50\%.},

	abstract = {Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 there has been a surge of interest in ecological restoration (ER) to recover biodiversity, re-establish ecosystem functioning and connectivity, and reactivate the delivery of ecosystem services. In policy spheres, there have also been repeated calls for expansion of restoration efforts. In many countries, new legislation now requires some form of restoration and/or a form of offset investment. All of this will require major increases in financial allocations toward restoration science, technology, and implementation, and much more detailed valuation techniques. The economics of restoration is a new field emerging to support these needs. Our paper here starts with an analysis of the articles and reviews published on this broad subject from 1928 to 2012, as captured in the Scopus academic search platform. Our goal is to present and summarize what has been said and done in this area to date. Next, we map out one possible way forward, illustrated by examples and based on a coherent bundle of decision parameters related to the economics of ER and, more broadly, to the restoration of natural capital. The restoration of natural capital is defined as activities that integrate investment in, and replenishment of, natural capital stocks to improve the flows of ecosystem goods and services, and the preservation of biodiversity, while enhancing all aspects of human well-being. We give special attention to system dynamic approaches and other promising tools and techniques.},

The effectiveness of species conservation through habitat restoration can be enhanced by explicitly considering ‘habitat availability’, the combined effects of the total amount of habitat and its spatial configuration. We develop an approach for prioritizing land for restoration in a complex biome, considering habitat availability, land acquisition cost and biogeographical representation. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods We evaluate alternative restoration prioritization strategies for two mammal species with widely different dispersal abilities and habitat patch requirements. Our strategies focused on minimizing cost while meeting targets for biogeographical subregion representation and habitat availability metrics. We evaluated solutions based on the expected post-restoration improvement in habitat availability per unit cost. Results Restoration through land acquisition to improve habitat availability for both species and to ensure 20\% forest cover within each of the Atlantic Forest biogeographical subregions would cost US\$ 17.5–20.5 billion. The 12.6 and 11.4 million ha of restored forest resulted in an increase of 10.5\% and 9.8\% in habitat area and 5518\% (55-fold) and 4100\% (41-fold) in future habitat availability for Leopardus pardalis and Caluromys philander, respectively. We found a high degree of concordance ({\textgreater} 75\%) among selected planning units for each species. Main conclusion Substantial improvements in habitat availability that benefit both species can be realized for minimal additional cost relative to solutions based solely on cost-minimization and biogeographical subregion representation. We demonstrate that metrics based on metapopulation theory can be quantified in complex systems and used in a systematic restoration prioritization approach to improve habitat availability cost-effectively. Concordance among priority areas for restoration for species with widely different dispersal abilities and habitat patch requirements supports the idea that many species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest might benefit from plans based on indicator species. This is particularly useful in data-deficient systems like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

The review summarizes recent estimates on changes in cropland, agricultural intensification, tropical deforestation, pasture expansion, and urbanization and identifies the still unmeasured land-cover changes. Climate-driven land-cover modifications interact with land-use changes. Land-use change is driven by synergetic factor combinations of resource scarcity leading to an increase in the pressure of production on resources, changing opportunities created by markets, outside policy intervention, loss of adaptive capacity, and changes in social organization and attitudes. The changes in ecosystem goods and services that result from land-use change feed back on the drivers of land-use change. A restricted set of dominant pathways of land-use change is identified. Land-use change can be understood using the concepts of complex adaptive systems and transitions. Integrated, place-based research on land-use/land-cover change requires a combination of the agent-based systems and narrative perspectives of understanding. We argue in this paper that a systematic analysis of local-scale land-use change studies, conducted over a range of timescales, helps to uncover general principles that provide an explanation and prediction of new land-use changes.},

In recent years, however, conservation professionals have begun to recognize the importance of evaluation both for accountability and for improving project interventions. Even with this growing interest in evaluation, the conservation community has paid little attention to evaluation design. Recent literature includes some discussion of design, but it has focused primarily on experimental and quasiexperimental design and the use of counterfactuals. Real-life conservation projects, however, operate in complex and dynamic contexts and under conditions of limited resources, which limit the feasibility of counterfactual or experimental designs. There is, in fact, a range of design options to evaluate conservation interventions. The conservation community must educate itself about these options, and how different designs produce different results. This chapter discusses evaluation design alternatives in light of the unique challenges that influence evaluation design selection in conservation. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, in a context of strong political pressure for loosening environmental protections, the future impacts of a nationwide implementation of the Forest Code on both environment and agriculture remain poorly understood. Here, we present a spatially explicit assessment of Brazil’s 2012 Forest Code through the year 2050; specifically, we use a partial equilibrium economic model that provides a globally consistent national modeling framework with detailed representation of the agricultural sector and spatially explicit land-use change. We test for the combined or isolated impacts of the different measures of the Forest Code, including deforestation control and obligatory forest restoration with or without environmental reserve quotas. Our results show that, if rigorously enforced, the Forest Code could prevent a net loss of 53.4 million hectares (Mha) of forest and native vegetation by 2050, 43.1 Mha (81\%) of which are in the Amazon alone. The control of illegal deforestation promotes the largest environmental benefits, but the obligatory restoration of illegally deforested areas creates 12.9 Mha of new forested area. Environmental reserve quotas further protect 5.8 Mha of undisturbed natural vegetation. Compared to a scenario without the Forest Code, by 2050, cropland area is only reduced by 4\% and the cattle herd by 8\%. Our results show that compliance with the Forest Code requires an increase in cattle productivity of 56\% over four decades, with a combination of a higher use of supplements and an adoption of semi-intensive pasture management. We estimate that the enforcement of the Forest Code could contribute up to 1.03 PgCO 2 e to the ambitious GHG emissions reduction target set by Brazil for 2030.},

But the path to this target remains unclear due to a lack of information on its economics and implementation challenges. Here, we begin to fill this gap by developing a spatially-explicit model for Minas Gerais state that estimates the costs and benefits of native vegetation regeneration under different restoration approaches. Our results show that 36\% (0.7 million ha) of the Forest Code debt in Minas Gerais can be restored using only passive restoration, at a cost of US\$ 175 ± 47 million. Adding low-cost assisted natural regeneration would increase that number to 75\% (1.5 million ha) at a cost of US\$ 776 ± 137 million over a 20 yr period. This would result in a potential sequestration of 284 MtCO 2 e. However, including the intensive planting methods needed to restore the remaining 25\% of highly degraded areas—to fully solve the Forest Code debt and result in a potential sequestration of 345 MtCO 2 e—would more than double the costs to US\$ 1.7 ± 0.3 billion. Our results emphasize the need to implement regional policies that take advantage of the natural regeneration potential as well as prioritize the restoration of areas key to ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56\% and 19 to 56\% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74\%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.

	abstract = {Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.},

We found records of certiﬁed cropland in 133 countries, and estimated that certiﬁed crop area increased by 11\% (range 8.8–13.5\%) per year from 2000 to 2012, but still only covered 1.1\% (range 1.0–1.2\%) of global cropland. The crops with the highest levels of certiﬁcation were heavily traded commodities: coffee, cocoa, tea, and palm oil each had 10\% or more of their total global production area certiﬁed. Coverage was lower for other crops, including the world’s most important staple foods (maize, rice, and wheat). Sustainability standards have considerable potential to contribute to conservation, but there is an ongoing need for better evaluation of how effectively they are implemented. We present examples of ways in which governments, companies, ﬁnancial institutions, and civil society can work together to scale up and target certiﬁcation to places where it can have the greatest positive impact.},

	abstract = {Despite the high diversity of trees in the tropics, very few native species have been used in plantations. In a scenario of high international demand for nature conservation, ecological restoration and for the provision of forest products, mixed species forestry in the tropics emerges as a promising option. In this study, we examine three large experiments in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil that combine early Eucalyptus wood production with a high diversity (23–30 species) of native tree species. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) Eucalyptus growth and survival is higher in mixed plantations than in monocultures, while that of native species is lower when intercropped with Eucalyptus; (2) The diameter of target native trees is influenced by the size and by the identity of neighboring trees; (3) The negative effect of competition from Eucalyptus on native species is directly related to their growth rate. We compared mixtures of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species with Eucalyptus monocultures and with plots containing only native species, replacing Eucalyptus by ten native species. To test our hypotheses, we examined inventory data considering the stand- and the tree-levels. We calculated survival rate, diameter and height growth and basal area of whole stands and groups of species. We also used a neighborhood index analysis to separate the effect of total competition (i.e. stand density) and the influence of groups of species (intra- and inter-specific competition). The Eucalyptus trees in high diversity mixtures grew larger and yielded nearly 75\% of the basal area produced by Eucalyptus monocultures even though this genus accounted for only 50\% of seedlings in the mixtures. In the mixtures, Eucalyptus negatively affected the growth of native species proportionate to the native species’ growth rate. With some exceptions, the mixed plantations had no overall negative effect on tree survival or height growth. We conclude that mixtures of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species are feasible and represent a potential alternative for establishing multipurpose plantations, especially in the context of forest and landscape restoration.},

	abstract = {International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44\%–75\% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies.},

	abstract = {Forest loss is mainly due to the conversion of forest to agriculture, mostly in private lands. Forest restoration is a global priority, yet restoration targets are ambitious and budget-limited. Therefore, assessing the outcome of alternative decisions on land-use within private lands is paramount to perform cost-effective restoration. We present a novel framework that incorporates spatial planning for forest restoration within private lands with conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale. As a case study, we used three real landscapes of 10.000 ha with differing amounts of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, and three hypothetical animal species with different dispersal abilities. We estimated the total amount of forest that landholders must restore to comply with the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which requires landholders to reforest 20\% of their land within a 20-year time frame. We compared the cost-effectiveness of five restoration strategies based on the improvement in habitat availability and restoration costs. The most cost-effective strategy depends on a landscape’s initial amount of forest cover and the species of concern. We revealed that spatial planning for restoration in private lands increased habitat availability up to 12 times more than random restoration, which was always the least cost-effective strategy. Cost-effective large-scale restoration in Brazil depends on public policies that assist landholders to comply with the law and on prioritizing areas for restoration within private lands. We show that by adding habitat availability as target in spatial prioritization, benefits for biodiversity can be hastened at low additional cost, even in real world scenarios with severe spatial constraints. Despite constraints, spatially planned restoration for law compliance in Brazil increased landscape permeability by creating corridors and stepping stones. Our framework should be used to plan restoration in Brazilian private lands and can be customized for other regions worldwide.},

Mathematical optimisation is a quantitative and transparent framework for solving these problems. Despite several advantages of exact methods such as integer linear programming (ILP), most conservation planning problems to date have been solved using heuristic approaches such as simulated annealing (SA). We explain how to implement common conservation planning problems (e.g. Marxan and Marxan With Zones) in an ILP framework and how these formulations can be extended to account for spatial dependencies among planning units, such as those arising from environmental flows (e.g. rivers). Using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that ILP outperforms SA with respect to both solution quality (how close it is to optimality) and processing time over a range of problem sizes. For modestly sized quadratic problems (100,000 spatial units and 10 species), for example, a processing time of approximately 14h was required for SA to achieve a solution within 19\% of optimality, while ILP achieved solutions within 0.5\% of optimality within 30s. For the largest quadratic problems we evaluated processing time exceeding one day was required for SA to achieve a solution within 49\% of optimality, while ILP achieved solutions within 0.5\% of optimality in approximately one hour. Heuristics are conceptually simple and can be applied to large and non-linear objective functions but unlike ILP, produce solutions of unknown quality. We also discuss how ILP approaches also facilitate quantification of trade-off curves and sensitivity analysis. When solving linear or quadratic conservation planning problems we recommend using ILP over heuristic approaches whenever possible.},

Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS {\textgreater} SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS {\textgreater} SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS {\textgreater} SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS {\textgreater} SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL {\textgreater} SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL {\textgreater} SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS {\textgreater} SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

We quantified the degree of land modification and the amount and spatial configuration of low modified lands (i.e., natural areas relatively free from human alteration) across all ecoregions and biomes. We identified that fewer unmodified lands remain than previously reported and that most of the world is in a state of intermediate modification, with 52\% of ecoregions classified as moderately modified. Given that these moderately modified ecoregions fall within critical land use thresholds, we propose that they warrant elevated attention and require proactive spatial planning to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function before important environmental values are lost.},

	abstract = {Agricultural landscape homogenization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and key ecosystem services. Increasing agricultural landscape heterogeneity by increasing seminatural cover can help to mitigate biodiversity loss. However, the amount of seminatural cover is generally low and difficult to increase in many intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We hypothesized that increasing the heterogeneity of the crop mosaic itself (hereafter “crop heterogeneity”) can also have positive effects on biodiversity. In 8 contrasting regions of Europe and North America, we selected 435 landscapes along independent gradients of crop diversity and mean field size. Within each landscape, we selected 3 sampling sites in 1, 2, or 3 crop types. We sampled 7 taxa (plants, bees, butterflies, hoverflies, carabids, spiders, and birds) and calculated a synthetic index of multitrophic diversity at the landscape level. Increasing crop heterogeneity was more beneficial for multitrophic diversity than increasing seminatural cover. For instance, the effect of decreasing mean field size from 5 to 2.8 ha was as strong as the effect of increasing seminatural cover from 0.5 to 11\%. Decreasing mean field size benefited multitrophic diversity even in the absence of seminatural vegetation between fields. Increasing the number of crop types sampled had a positive effect on landscape-level multitrophic diversity. However, the effect of increasing crop diversity in the landscape surrounding fields sampled depended on the amount of seminatural cover. Our study provides large-scale, multitrophic, cross-regional evidence that increasing crop heterogeneity can be an effective way to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes without taking land out of agricultural production.},

Here, we analyze the impact of the distance between forest fragments and oilseed crops (Brassica napus) on the crops' yield (kg/ha) and economic value (US\$). For crop yield, the total loss field−1 was calculated as the difference between the most lucrative parcel and the least lucrative parcel. Hypothetical models were developed to estimate the potential changes in crop incomes due to progressive replacement of the lowest income crop area(s) by natural vegetation. Our findings demonstrate a significant decrease in the mean number of seeds per silique and in seed production as the distance from forest fragment progressively increases. The productivity loss throughout this gradient may reach up to 2760 kg/ha (i.e. US\$804.08). Our models indicate that parcels further than 325 m from forest fragments were poorly pollinated. Our models also demonstrated that farmers could boost their yields if more natural areas (as small as 5\%) were included inside crop fields, even though this reduces their arable area. In conclusion, adding small natural patches within crop fields will most likely lead to a higher seed production and successive increases in the economic value of canola crops.},

The technical potential to reconcile these roles by concentrating agriculture on existing farmland and sparing land for nature is well-established, but the spatial overlap of this potential with conservation priorities and institutional constraints remains poorly understood. We mapped conservation priorities, food production potential and socio-economic variables likely to influence the success of land sparing. Pasture occupies 70\% of agricultural land but contributes ≤11\% of the domestic food supply. Increasing yields on pasture would add little to Brazil’s food supply but – if combined with concerted conservation and restoration policies – provides the greatest opportunities for reducing land demand. Our study illustrates a method for identifying municipalities where land-sparing policies are most likely to succeed, and those where further effort is needed to overcome constraints such as land tenure insecurity, lack of access to technical advice, labour constraints, and non-compliance with environmental law.},

Edge effects (biophysical gradients near habitat boundaries) might reduce population sizes on spared land, particularly in highly-fragmented landscapes, so might change conclusions about whether land sparing or land sharing is better for species' persistence. We assessed this possibility by modelling the population sizes of 120 Ghanaian bird species in the presence of a range of hypothetical edge effects under land-sparing and land-sharing strategies, and at different levels of habitat fragmentation and agricultural production. We found that edge effects can reduce population densities on spared land, and in highly-fragmented landscapes can – at modest levels of agricultural production combined with high edge penetration distances – cause the optimal strategy to switch from land sparing to land sharing. Nevertheless, land sparing maximised population sizes for more species in most cases tested. This conclusion was best supported for sensitive species with small global geographical ranges, which are likely to include those of greatest future conservation concern. The size of patches of spared land affected conservation outcomes: population sizes were maximised under a land-sparing strategy that spared large blocks of natural habitat of {\textasciitilde}1000 or, better, {\textasciitilde}10,000 ha. To effect land sparing in practice would require policies that promoted both increases in agricultural yield and the establishment or protection of natural habitats on spared land. Because the optimum scale of patches of spared land for edge-sensitive species is generally larger than the size of individual farms, policies that facilitate coordinated action by farmers or other land managers might be required.},

	abstract = {The low productivity of many tropical pasturelands is a major driver of deforestation and other negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. In Brazil, the second biggest meat producer in the world, 85\% of cattle farms remain within extensive pasture systems, and cattle farming is by far the most important proximate driver of deforestation. It is possible to expand Brazilian agriculture with zero deforestation through improvements to rangeland productivity yet understanding of the challenges and motivations of the actual cattle farmers in the face of such a transition remains sparse. To better understand the importance of the underlying factors that lead to or inhibit improvements to land management, we used focus groups and semi-structured interviews (N=250) with farmers from the state of Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazon. We found that the majority of the respondents (60\%) claimed that the principal benefit of adopting good agricultural practices was increased productivity, followed by increased income (43\%) and better farm administrative management (34\%). The adoption of improved pasture management techniques was positively correlated with stocking rates (p{\textless}0.005, r=0.48). Farms that adopted improved pasture management, most often through rotational grazing had, on average, lower levels of forest cover (p{\textless}0.05, r=0.22). We found that scarcity of labour was the major issue affecting the adoption of improved techniques (36\%), followed by financial constraints (18\%). We also identified a shortfall in access to technical extension services to be a significant problem because 40\% of the technical assistance is currently provided by vendors of fertilizers and other chemicals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the barriers to and the conditions surrounding the adoption of good agricultural practices in Brazilian pasturelands from the perspective of the farmers from the Amazon involved in the implementation of these practices. It is critical that decision-makers involved in the design of technical assistance schemes, education and credit programmes consider these factors if sustainable land management is to be realised at scale. In particular, the lack of skilled and available labour contrasts with the widespread assumption that new credit lines for sustainable agriculture will automatically result in better land management. A failure to consider factors discussed in this paper may contribute to the continued clearance of native vegetation and the environmental degradation of existing pasturelands, in addition to the persistence of widespread poverty among cattle-farmers. These results can assist the large scale implementation of sustainable land use policies in Brazil and elsewhere.},

As species become threatened and vanish, so too do the broader ecosystems and myriad benefits to human well-being that depend upon biodiversity. Bringing an end to global biodiversity loss requires that limited available resources be guided to those regions that need it most. The biodiversity hotspots do this based on the conservation planning principles of irreplaceability and vulnerability. Here, we review the development of the hotspots over the past two decades and present an analysis of their biodiversity, updated to the current set of 35 regions. We then discuss past and future efforts needed to conserve them, sustaining their fundamental role both as the home of a substantial fraction of global biodiversity and as the ultimate source of many ecosystem services upon which humanity depends.},

The global portfolio of PES programs is estimated to represent an annual investment of more than USD \$36 billion. Despite this substantial investment, the continued lack of systematic and rigorous impact evaluation of PES has contributed to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this tool for conservation. Here, we assessed the ability of two watershed PES programs to promote native forest conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Those two focal programs are among the most well-established PES programs in Brazil, and form part of a larger network of PES programs intended to protect the drinking water supply of over 19 million people in the São Paulo metropolitan region. Using a counterfactual approach, we examined if enrollment in a PES program contributed to the conservation of on-farm native forest cover. With propensity score matching, we identified a set of neighboring, non-enrolled ‘control’ properties, with similar size, altitude, soil type, demographic density, presence of water sources and forest cover. We then estimated forest cover on enrolled and control properties before and after PES implementation with a differences-in-differences method, modeled as the probability of an observed change in on-farm forest area as a consequence of PES enrollment. We found that PES has a positive effect on forest cover, with PES enrollment over a five-year period associated with an additional 2.8–5.6\% of farm area coverage in native Atlantic Forest, through forest regeneration. PES enrollment was associated with a non-significant trend toward decreased loss of vegetation. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the contribution of PES to additionality in forest conservation. While positive, the relatively slow impact of PES on forest regeneration suggests that environmental managers should not count exclusively on PES mechanism to achieve conservation goals.},

The global demand for agricultural goods has imposed strong pressure on natural areas, and the economic decisions of agribusiness managers are crucial to the fate of Cerrado domain remaining areas (CDRA) in Brazil. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of Brazilian private protected areas policy, and to propose a feasible alternative to promote CDRA protection. This article assessed the main agribusiness opportunity costs for natural areas preservation: the land use profitability and the arable land price. The CDRA percentage and the opportunity costs were estimated for 349 municipal districts of São Paulo State through secondary spatial data and profitability values of 38 main agricultural products. We found that Brazilian private protected areas policy fails to preserve CDRA, although the values of non-compliance fines were higher than average opportunity costs. The scenario with very restrictive laws on private protected areas and historical high interest rates allowed us to conceive a feasible cross compliance proposal to improve environmental and agricultural policies.},

The lack of rigorous analyses about the major components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil’s National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys (60–90\%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of magnitude cheaper but were reported in {\textless}15\% of projects. The vast majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during the implementation phase, and nearly 80\% of projects ended maintenance within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US\$0.7-1.2 billion per year until 2030 to implement Brazil’s restoration plan depending on the area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up restoration at a global scale.},

	abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

	abstract = {A primary focus of wildlife ecology is studying how the arrangement, quality, and distribution of habitat influence wildlife populations at multiple spatial scales. A practical limitation of conducting wildlife–habitat investigations in the field, however, is that sampling points tend to be close to one another, resulting in spatial clustering. Consequently, when ecologists seek to quantify the effects of environmental predictors surrounding their sampling points, they encounter the issue of using landscapes that are partially or completely overlapping. A presumed problem of overlapping landscapes is that data generated from these landscapes, when used as predictors in statistical modeling, might violate the assumption of independence. However, the independence of error is the critical assumption, not the independence of predictor variables. Nonetheless, many researchers strive to avoid such overlaps through sampling design or alternative analytical procedures and specialized software programs have been created to assist with this. We present theoretical arguments and empirical evidence showing that changing the amount of overlap does not alter the degree of spatial autocorrelation. Using data derived from 2 broad-scaled avian monitoring programs, we quantified the relationship between forest cover and bird abundance and occurrence at multiple landscapes ranging from 100 m to 24 km across. We found no clear evidence that increasing overlap of landscapes increased spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. Our results demonstrate that the concern of overlapping landscapes as a potential cause of violation of spatial independency among sampling units is misdirected and represents an oversimplification of the statistical and ecological issues surrounding spatial autocorrelation. Overlapping landscapes and spatial autocorrelation are separate issues in the modeling of wildlife populations and their habitats; non-overlapping landscapes do not ensure spatial independency and overlapping landscapes do not necessarily lead to greater spatial autocorrelation in model errors. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Most current research on land-use intensification addresses its potential to either threaten biodiversity or to boost agricultural production. However, little is known about the simultaneous effects of intensification on biodiversity and yield. To determine the responses of species richness and yield to conventional intensification, we conducted a global meta-analysis synthesizing 115 studies which collected data for both variables at the same locations. We extracted 449 cases that cover a variety of areas used for agricultural (crops, fodder) and silvicultural (wood) production. We found that, across all production systems and species groups, conventional intensification is successful in increasing yield (grand mean + 20.3\%), but it also results in a loss of species richness (−8.9\%). However, analysis of sub-groups revealed inconsistent results. For example, small intensification steps within low intensity systems did not affect yield or species richness. Within high-intensity systems species losses were non-significant but yield gains were substantial (+15.2\%). Conventional intensification within medium intensity systems revealed the highest yield increase (+84.9\%) and showed the largest loss in species richness (−22.9\%). Production systems differed in their magnitude of richness response, with insignificant changes in silvicultural systems and substantial losses in crop systems (−21.2\%). In addition, this meta-analysis identifies a lack of studies that collect robust biodiversity (i.e. beyond species richness) and yield data at the same sites and that provide quantitative information on land-use intensity. Our findings suggest that, in many cases, conventional land-use intensification drives a trade-off between species richness and production. However, species richness losses were often not significantly different from zero, suggesting even conventional intensification can result in yield increases without coming at the expense of biodiversity loss. These results should guide future research to close existing research gaps and to understand the circumstances required to achieve such win-win or win-no-harm situations in conventional agriculture.},

Several studies have previously shown that pollination services are greater in crops adjoining forest patches or other seminatural habitats than in crops completely surrounded by other crops. In this study, we investigated the specific importance of forest edges in providing potential pollinators in B. napus fields in two areas in France. Bees were caught with yellow pan traps at increasing distances from both warm and cold forest edges into B. napus fields during the blooming period. A total of 4594 individual bees, representing six families and 83 taxa, were collected. We found that both bee abundance and taxa richness were negatively affected by the distance from forest edge. However, responses varied between bee groups and edge orientations. The ITD (Inter-Tegular distance) of the species, a good proxy for bee foraging range, seems to limit how far the bees can travel from the forest edge. We found a greater abundance of cuckoo bees (Nomada spp.) of Andrena spp. and Andrena spp. males at forest edges, which we assume indicate suitable nesting sites, or at least mating sites, for some abundant Andrena species and their parasites (Fig. ). Synthesis and Applications. This study provides one of the first examples in temperate ecosystems of how forest edges may actually act as a reservoir of potential pollinators and directly benefit agricultural crops by providing nesting or mating sites for important early spring pollinators. Policy-makers and land managers should take forest edges into account and encourage their protection in the agricultural matrix to promote wild bees and their pollination services.

	abstract = {Abstract: Crop pollination by wild bees is an ecosystem service of enormous value, but it is under increasing threat from agricultural intensification. As with many ecosystem services, the mechanisms, scales, and species through which crop pollination is provided are too poorly understood to inform land-use decisions. I investigated the role of tropical forest remnants as sources of pollinators to surrounding coffee crops in Costa Rica. In 2001 and 2002 I observed bee activity and pollen deposition rates at coffee flowers along distance gradients from two fragments and one narrow riparian strip of forest. Eleven eusocial species were the most common visitors: 10 species of native meliponines and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (hereafter Apis). Bee richness, overall visitation rate, and pollen deposition rate were all significantly higher in sites within approximately 100 m of forest fragments than in sites farther away (maximum distance of 1.6 km). Apis visitation rates were constant across the distance gradient, however, and Apis accounted for {\textgreater}90\% of all floral visits in distant sites. The gradient from the riparian strip showed a similar drop in bee species richness with distance, but visitation rates were uniformly low along the gradient. Throughout the study area, Apis abundances declined sharply from 2001 to 2002, reducing visitation rates by over 50\% in distant sites (where Apis was almost the only pollinator). In near sites, however, overall visitation rates dropped only 9\% because native species almost entirely compensated for the Apis decline. Forest fragments (more so than the riparian strip) thus provided nearby coffee with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of pollination services by reducing dependence on a single introduced pollinator. Exploring the economic links between forest preservation and coffee cultivation may help align the goals of conservation and agriculture within many regions of global conservation priority.},

	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of global mean temperature rises are worrisome for coffee crop due to the intolerance of the Arabica species to high air temperature variations. The crop has a large participation in the Brazilian trade balance; therefore, in this study, the impacts of climate change on the potential yield of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.) were assessed in the areas of Southeast Brazil in future climate change scenarios. Simulations of the Eta Regional Climate Model at 5-km resolution used in this study were generated from a second dynamic downscaling of the HadGEM2-ES model runs. The projections adopted two scenarios of greenhouse gas concentration, the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and considered the period 2011–2100. The projections indicated a large reduction of about 20 to 60\% of the areas currently suitable for coffee cultivation in Southeast Brazil. In the RCP8.5 scenario, at the end of century, coffee cultivation is suitable only in elevated mountain areas, which would pose difficulties to farming management due to the operation of agricultural machinery in mountain areas. In addition, coffee cultivation in these regions could produce environmental impacts in the remnant Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Areas of high climatic risk increase due to temperature increase. The projections showed that the potential yield could be reduced by about 25\% by the end of the twenty-first century. These results of potential coffee yield in the future climate indicate a need for adaptation studies of Arabica coffee cultivation.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This guide to estimating daily and monthly actual, potential, reference crop and pan evaporation covers topics that are of interest to researchers, consulting hydrologists and practicing engineers. Topics include estimating actual evaporation from deep lakes and from farm dams and for catchment water balance studies, estimating potential evaporation as input to rainfall-runoff models, and reference crop evapotranspiration for small irrigation areas, and for irrigation within large irrigation districts. Inspiration for this guide arose in response to the authors' experiences in reviewing research papers and consulting reports where estimation of the actual evaporation component in catchment and water balance studies was often inadequately handled. Practical guides using consistent terminology that cover both theory and practice are not readily available. Here we provide such a guide, which is divided into three parts. The first part provides background theory and an outline of the conceptual models of potential evaporation of Penman, Penman–Monteith and Priestley–Taylor, as well as discussions of reference crop evapotranspiration and Class-A pan evaporation. The last two sub-sections in this first part include techniques to estimate actual evaporation from (i) open-surface water and (ii) landscapes and catchments (Morton and the advection-aridity models). The second part addresses topics confronting a practicing hydrologist, e.g. estimating actual evaporation for deep lakes, shallow lakes and farm dams, lakes covered with vegetation, catchments, irrigation areas and bare soil. The third part addresses six related issues: (i) automatic (hard wired) calculation of evaporation estimates in commercial weather stations, (ii) evaporation estimates without wind data, (iii) at-site meteorological data, (iv) dealing with evaporation in a climate change environment, (v) 24 h versus day-light hour estimation of meteorological variables, and (vi) uncertainty in evaporation estimates.  This paper is supported by a Supplement that includes 21 sections enhancing the material in the text, worked examples of many procedures discussed in the paper, a program listing (Fortran 90) of Morton's WREVAP evaporation models along with tables of monthly Class-A pan coefficients for 68 locations across Australia and other information.},

	abstract = {Coffee has proven to be highly sensitive to climate change. Because coffee plantations have a lifespan of about thirty years, the likely effects of future climates are already a concern. Forward-looking research on adaptation is therefore in high demand across the entire supply chain. In this paper we seek to project current and future climate suitability for coffee production (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora) on a global scale. We used machine learning algorithms to derive functions of climatic suitability from a database of geo-referenced production locations. Use of several parameter combinations enhances the robustness of our analysis. The resulting multi-model ensemble suggests that higher temperatures may reduce yields of C. arabica, while C. canephora could suffer from increasing variability of intra-seasonal temperatures. Climate change will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50 \% across emission scenarios. Impacts are highest at low latitudes and low altitudes. Impacts at higher altitudes and higher latitudes are still negative but less pronounced. The world’s dominant production regions in Brazil and Vietnam may experience substantial reductions in area available for coffee. Some regions in East Africa and Asia may become more suitable, but these are partially in forested areas, which could pose a challenge to mitigation efforts.},

The primary aims of this work were the identification and mapping of specific management areas allowing coffee bean quality to be predicted from soil attributes and their relationships to relief. The study area was located in the Southeast of the Minas Gerais state, Brazil. A grid containing a total of 145 uniformly spaced nodes 50 m apart was established over an area of 31.7 ha from which samples were collected at depths of 0.00–0.20 m in order to determine physical and chemical attributes of the soil. These data were analysed in conjunction with plant attributes including production, proportion of beans retained by different sieves and drink quality. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with geostatistical data showed the attributes clay content and available iron to be the best choices for identifying four crop production environments. Environment A, which exhibited high clay and available iron contents, and low pH and base saturation, was that providing the highest yield (30.4l ha−1) and best coffee beverage quality (61 sacks ha−1). Based on the results, we believe that multivariate analysis, geostatistics and the soil–relief relationships contained in the digital elevation model (DEM) can be effectively used in combination for the hybrid mapping of areas of varying suitability for coffee production.},

However, we still lack interdisciplinary methods to project future LULC scenarios at spatial scales that are relevant for local decision making and future environmental assessments. Here we apply an interdisciplinary approach to develop spatially explicit projections of LULC at a resolution of 30 × 30 m informed by historic relationships between LULC and their key drivers, within the context of the four qualitative scenarios of global shared socioeconomic pathways. We apply this methodology to a case study in the Zona da Mata, Brazil, which has a history of major LULC changes. The analysis of LULC changes from 1986 to 2015 indicates that pasture area decreased from 76 to 58 \% of total area, while forest areas increased from 18 to 24 \%, and coffee from 3 to 11 \%. Environmental protection legislation, rural credit for smallholder farmers, and demand for agricultural and raw products were identified as main drivers of LULC changes. Projected LULC for 2045 strongly depends on the global socioeconomic pathway scenarios, and forest and coffee areas may increase substantially under strong government measures in the environmentally conscious Green Road scenario or decrease in the high consumption Rocky Road scenario. Our study shows that under the set of drivers during the past three decades reforestation can go hand in hand with increase of agricultural production, but that major and contrasting changes in LULC can be expected depending on the socioeconomic pathway that will be followed in the future. To guide this process, LULC scenarios at the local scale can inform the planning of local and regional development and forest conservation.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic rainforest of Brazil is one of the global terrestrial hotspots of biodiversity. Despite having undergone large scale deforestation, forest cover has shown signs of increases in the last decades. Here, to understand the degradation and regeneration history of Atlantic rainforest remnants near São Paulo, we combine a unique dataset of very high resolution images from Worldview-2 and Worldview-3 (0.5 and 0.3m spatial resolution, respectively), georeferenced aerial photographs from 1962 and use a deep learning method called U-net to map (i) the forest cover and changes and (ii) two pioneer tree species, Cecropia hololeuca and Tibouchina pulchra. For Tibouchina pulchra, all the individuals were mapped in February, when the trees undergo mass-flowering with purple and pink blossoms. Additionally, elevation data at 30m spatial resolution from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and annual mean climate variables (Terraclimate datasets at ∼ 4km of spatial resolution) were used to analyse the forest and species distributions. We found that natural forests are currently more frequently found on south-facing slopes, likely because of geomorphology and past land use, and that Tibouchina is restricted to the wetter part of the region (southern part), which annually receives at least 1600 mm of precipitation. Tibouchina pulchra was found to clearly indicate forest regeneration as almost all individuals were found within or adjacent to forests regrown after 1962. By contrast, Cecropia hololeuca was found to indicate older disturbed forests, with all individuals almost exclusively found in forest fragments already present in 1962. At the regional scale, using the dominance maps of both species, we show that at least 4.3\% of the current region’s natural forests have regrown after 1962 (Tibouchina dominated, ∼ 4757 ha) and that ∼ 9\% of the old natural forests have experienced significant disturbance (Cecropia dominated).},

	abstract = {Managing agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity and ecosystem services is a key aim of a sustainable agriculture. However, how the spatial arrangement of crop fields and other habitats in landscapes impacts arthropods and their functions is poorly known. Synthesising data from 49 studies (1515 landscapes) across Europe, we examined effects of landscape composition (\% habitats) and configuration (edge density) on arthropods in fields and their margins, pest control, pollination and yields. Configuration effects interacted with the proportions of crop and non-crop habitats, and species’ dietary, dispersal and overwintering traits led to contrasting responses to landscape variables. Overall, however, in landscapes with high edge density, 70\% of pollinator and 44\% of natural enemy species reached highest abundances and pollination and pest control improved 1.7- and 1.4-fold respectively. Arable-dominated landscapes with high edge densities achieved high yields. This suggests that enhancing edge density in European agroecosystems can promote functional biodiversity and yield-enhancing ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {South America holds 30\% of the world's avifauna, with the Atlantic Forest representing one of the richest regions of the Neotropics. Here we have compiled a data set on Brazilian Atlantic Forest bird occurrence (150,423) and abundance samples (N = 832 bird species; 33,119 bird individuals) using multiple methods, including qualitative surveys, mist nets, point counts, and line transects). We used four main sources of data: museum collections, on-line databases, literature sources, and unpublished reports. The data set comprises 4,122 localities and data from 1815 to 2017. Most studies were conducted in the Florestas de Interior (1,510 localities) and Serra do Mar (1,280 localities) biogeographic sub-regions. Considering the three main quantitative methods (mist net, point count, and line transect), we compiled abundance data for 745 species in 576 communities. In the data set, the most frequent species were Basileuterus culicivorus, Cyclaris gujanensis, and Conophaga lineata. There were 71 singletons, such as Lipaugus conditus and Calyptura cristata. We suggest that this small number of records reinforces the critical situation of these taxa in the Atlantic Forest. The information provided in this data set can be used for macroecological studies and to foster conservation strategies in this biodiversity hotspot. No copyright restrictions are associated with the data set. Please cite this Data Paper if data are used in publications and teaching events.},

Average annual mean air temperature, mean air temperature of the coldest month, and moisture index were used to characterize climatic vulnerability for Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora species cultivation based on high-resolution interpolated climate surfaces from the average of the period of 1950 to 2000 and the A2 2080 climate change scenario. Soil vulnerability for coffee cultivation was derived from soil classes 1:5,000,000 scale and slope estimated from SRTM digital elevation model at 90 m spatial resolution. Coffee tree production at municipal district level from 1990 to 2006 was used to validate the obtained results of the vulnerability of coffee agroecosystems. A coffee tree index was developed using the principal components technique, based on variables related to coffee yield, coffee harvested and coffee cultivated areas. The coffee tree fraction index explained 87.0 \% of coffee tree fraction and was classified in five levels inside the municipal district boundaries using natural breaks method. Based on the adopted methodology, it was possible to observe relationship between coffee tree cultivation areas and coffee climatic vulnerability in Brazil for the scenario of 1950 to 2000. Considering A2 2080 scenario of climate change, suitable areas for coffee cultivation were moved to the states of the south and southeast of Brazil.},

	abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model’s predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry is widely promoted as a potential solution to address multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action, and Life on Land. Nonetheless, agroforests in the tropics often result from direct forest conversions, displacing rapidly vanishing and highly biodiverse forests with large carbon stocks, causing undesirable trade-offs. Scientists thus debate whether the promotion of agroforestry in tropical landscapes is a sensible policy. So far, this debate typically fails to consider land-use history, that is, whether an agroforest is derived from forest or from open land. Indeed, 57\% of papers which we systematically reviewed did not describe the land-use history of focal agroforestry systems. We further find that forest-derived agroforestry supports higher biodiversity than open-land-derived agroforestry but essentially represents a degradation of forest, whereas open-land-derived agroforestry rehabilitates formerly forested open land. Based on a conceptual framework, we recommend to (a) promote agroforestry on suitable open land, (b) maintain tree cover in existing forest-derived agroforests, and (c) conserve remaining forests. Land-use history should be incorporated into land-use policy to avoid incentivizing forest degradation and to harness the potential of agroforestry for ecosystem services and biodiversity.},

Flower strips, but not hedgerows, enhanced pest control services in adjacent ﬁelds by 16\% on average. However, eﬀects on crop pollination and yield were more variable. Our synthesis identiﬁes several important drivers of variability in eﬀectiveness of plantings: pollination services declined exponentially with distance from plantings, and perennial and older ﬂower strips with higher ﬂowering plant diversity enhanced pollination more eﬀectively. These ﬁndings provide promising pathways to optimize ﬂoral plantings to more eﬀectively contribute to ecosystem service delivery and ecological intensiﬁcation of agriculture in the future.},

A choice experiment of 189 farmers in the Cantareira region – the drinking water source for over nine million people in the São Paulo metropolitan area – suggests that existing PES contract incentives are unlikely to spur enrollment by landowners with small properties and high dependence on agricultural income. This group is unlikely to restore forest without compensation, and survey responses indicate they need a much higher payment than current payment structures provide. Our results also provide support for the inclusion of in-kind incentives that increase agricultural productivity as a means to encourage participation. These findings are especially important in light of Brazil's commitments to forest restoration under the country's Native Vegetation Protection Law and its commitments through the Bonn Challenge to restore 15 million hectares of Atlantic Forest by 2050.},

This special issue highlights challenges and opportunities for governing FLR at different scales and under different contexts across a range of tropical and subtropical forest biomes. In this introductory paper, we explore common threads from diverse studies comprising the special issue to highlight key challenges for effective governance of FLR across many different contexts. We discuss enabling factors and conditions that can help to overcome deficiencies in governance processes and outcomes and illustrate how these conditions are linked to the six principles of FLR.

	abstract = {Brazil is home to the largest tracts of tropical vegetation in the world, harbouring high levels of biodiversity and carbon. Several biomass maps have been produced for Brazil, using different approaches and methods, and for different purposes. These maps have been used to estimate historic, recent, and future carbon emissions from land use change (LUC). It can be difficult to determine which map to use for what purpose. The implications of using an unsuitable map can be significant, since the maps have large differences, both in terms of total carbon storage and its spatial distribution. This paper presents comparisons of Brazil's new ?official? carbon map; that is, the map used in the third national communication to the UNFCCC in 2016, with the former official map, and four carbon maps from the scientific literature. General strengths and weaknesses of the different maps are identified, including their suitability for different types of studies. No carbon map was found suitable for studies concerned with existing land use/cover (LULC) and LUC outside of existing forests, partly because they do not represent the current LULC sufficiently well, and partly because they generally overestimate carbon values for agricultural land. A new map of aboveground carbon is presented, which was created based on data from existing maps and an up-to-date LULC map. This new map reflects current LULC, has high accuracy and resolution (50 m), and a national coverage. It can be a useful alternative for scientific studies and policy initiatives concerned with existing LULC and LUC outside of existing forests, especially at local scales when high resolution is necessary, and/or outside the Amazon biome. We identify five ongoing climate policy initiatives in Brazil that can benefit from using this map.},

	abstract = {Land use leads to massive habitat destruction and fragmentation in tropical forests. Despite its global dimensions the effects of fragmentation on ecosystem dynamics are not well understood due to the complexity of the problem. We present a simulation analysis performed by the individual-based model FORMIND. The model was applied to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hot spots, at the Plateau of São Paulo. This study investigates the long-term effects of fragmentation processes on structure and dynamics of different sized remnant tropical forest fragments (1–100ha) at community and plant functional type (PFT) level. We disentangle the interplay of single effects of different key fragmentation processes (edge mortality, increased mortality of large trees, local seed loss and external seed rain) using simulation experiments in a full factorial design. Our analysis reveals that particularly small forest fragments below 25ha suffer substantial structural changes, biomass and biodiversity loss in the long term. At community level biomass is reduced up to 60\%. Two thirds of the mid- and late-successional species groups, especially shade-tolerant (late successional climax) species groups are prone of extinction in small fragments. The shade-tolerant species groups were most strongly affected; its tree number was reduced more than 60\% mainly by increased edge mortality. This process proved to be the most powerful of those investigated, explaining alone more than 80\% of the changes observed for this group. External seed rain was able to compensate approximately 30\% of the observed fragmentation effects for shade-tolerant species. Our results suggest that tropical forest fragments will suffer strong structural changes in the long term, leading to tree species impoverishment. They may reach a new equilibrium with a substantially reduced subset of the initial species pool, and are driven towards an earlier successional state. The natural regeneration potential of a landscape scattered with forest fragments appears to be limited, as external seed rain is not able to fully compensate for the observed fragmentation-induced changes. Our findings suggest basic recommendations for the management of fragmented tropical forest landscapes.},

	abstract = {We develop a theory of change for payments for environmental services (PES) to review their imminent strengths and weaknesses in light of a growing body of impact evaluation studies. We show that PES are probably at least as environmentally additional as other conservation tools, based on the limited evidence. The original vision of PES as being direct, flexible, and potentially effective remains valid, but PES design and implementation have to be upgraded in their economic functioning to better realize this potential. Adverse self-selection, inadequate administrative targeting, and ill-enforced conditionality constitute three key obstacles that may considerably hamper PES success. Policies such as spatial targeting to service density, threat and cost levels, and payment differentiation can alleviate the design challenges. PES site selection needs to further move into high-threat areas. Making adequate PES design choices also requires the political will to boost environmental effects.

This edition of The State of the World’s Forests is aimed at enhancing our understanding of how forests and their sustainable management contribute to achieving several of the SDGs. Time is running out for the world’s forests: we need to work across sectors, bring stakeholders together, and take urgent action. The State of the World’s Forests 2018 identifies actions that can be taken to increase the contributions of forests and trees that are necessary to accelerate progress towards the SDGs. It is now critical that steps be taken to work more effectively with the private sector, and the informal forest sector must be transformed in order to bring broader economic, social and environmental benefits. Seventy years ago, when FAO completed its first assessment of the world’s forest resources, the major concern was whether there would be enough timber to supply global demand; now we recognize the greater global relevance of our forests and trees. For the first time, The State of the World’s Forests 2018 provides an assessment of the contribution of forests and trees to our landscapes and livelihoods. The purpose of this publication is to provide a much wider audience with an understanding of why forests and trees matter for people, the planet and posterity.

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

	abstract = {Congratulations to Elinor Ostrom, Co-Winner of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009! The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

	abstract = {How do we redesign agricultural landscapes to maintain their productivity and profitability, while promoting rather than eradicating biodiversity, and regenerating rather than undermining the ecological processes that sustain food production and are vital for a liveable planet? Ecological intensification harnesses ecological processes to increase food production per area through management processes that often diversify croplands to support beneficial organisms supplying these services. By adding more diverse vegetation back into landscapes, the agricultural matrix can also become both more habitable and more permeable to biodiversity, aiding in conserving biodiversity over time. By reducing the need for costly inputs while maintaining productivity, ecological intensification methods can maintain or even enhance profitability. As shown with several examples, ecological intensification and diversification can assist in creating multifunctional landscapes that are more environmentally and economically sustainable. While single methods of ecological intensification can be incorporated into large-scale industrial farms and reduce negative impacts, complete redesign of such systems using multiple methods of ecological intensification and diversification can create truly regenerative systems with strong potential to promote food production and biodiversity. However, the broad adoption of these methods will require transformative socio-economic changes because many structural barriers continue to maintain the current agrichemical model of agriculture.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the main examples of the interface humankind-nature-technology. However, innovation in agriculture has often been associated to only one component of this tryptic: technology – in particular its development, use and application. In this paper, we argue that the innovation space in agriculture is migrating from an emphasis in technology, aiming to achieve economic goals related to productivity, to an emphasis on the relationship humankind-nature, aiming for a greater balance between social, economic and environmental goals. This shift is gaining traction in the 21st Century, largely in response to the limits imposed by the Anthropocene. Therefore, many of the various branches of agroecology emerge as important innovations. We examine one in particular, the syntropic agriculture, as a case study of an innovative approach to sustainable farming. We argue that syntropic agriculture is scalable and has had an increasing adoption in Brazil and many other countries. It successfully achieves productivity targets, while promoting succession and regeneration of native ecosystems. This pattern results from the combination of a rationale that blends scientific and traditional knowledge, a practice that resorts to no-impact or low-impact technologies, and a philosophy that perceives humankind and nature as integrated and interdependent.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are critical for protecting global biodiversity and carbon stores. While forest degradation and fragmentation cause negative impacts on trees, many woody lianas benefit, with associated negative effects on carbon storage. Here, we focus on the key question of how abiotic environmental changes resulting from tropical forest fragmentation mediate the allocation of carbon into trees and lianas. We focus on the globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, in forest fragments spanning 13–23 442 ha in area and at fragment edges and interiors. Within each fragment, we established two transects: one at the edge and one in the interior. Each transect consisted of ten 10 × 10 m plots spaced at 20 m intervals. Within each plot, we sampled living trees with diameter ≥4·8 cm at 1·3 m above ground, living lianas with diameter ≥1·6 cm at 10 cm above ground, and several microclimatic and soil variables. Fragmentation changed a broad suite of abiotic environmental conditions recognized as being associated with forest carbon stocks: edges and smaller fragments were hotter, windier, and less humid, with more fertile and less acid soils at edges. Tree carbon stocks were thus higher in forest interiors than at edges, and were positively related to fragment size in interiors, but were not impacted by fragment size at edges. Trees and lianas showed different responses to fragmentation: in interiors of small fragments, tree carbon stocks declined whereas liana carbon stocks increased; and at edges, tree carbon stocks were not affected by fragment size, whereas liana carbon stocks were highest in smaller fragments. These patterns were strongly related to changes in abiotic environmental conditions. We conclude that the abiotic changes across the fragmentation gradient, rather than liana proliferation, were more likely to reduce tree carbon stocks. Cutting of lianas is frequently promoted for restoring forest carbon in human-modified tropical forests. However, this approach may not be effective for restoring forest carbon stocks in fragmented forests.},

	abstract = {The discourse analysis applied to the implementation of São Paulo State’s new Forest Code allows a better understanding of the establishment of this law and it can help with the guidance of more effective policies. The analysis of 243 documents showed that there are three main discourses in this context, each one represented by a set of storylines and actors’ coalitions. The first discourse, called social economic, is composed of storylines focused on the environmental regularization process, on private property rights, and the economic value of land. A second discourse, called environmental conservationist, is based on the value of the ecosystem services and on the insufficiency of the State law in protecting such resource. The third discourse emphasizes the need for strategies to obtain a balance between the economic land use of properties and the conservation of native vegetation. The State level reflects the conflicts in place since the 1965 Forest Code review. Factors as the use of conflict as a strategy for following specific stakes and the current Brazilian political context, impair the establishment of a solution of balance, like the one proposed by the last discourse. In this paper, the main discourses about the establishment of São Paulo State’s new Forest Code were identified and their role in the implementation of this policy were analyzed. A better understanding about these conflicts can help in the process of decision making aimed at this winwin situation in economic and environmental terms.},

	abstract = {Natural regeneration is key for large-scale forest restoration, yet it may lead to different biodiversity outcomes depending on socio-environmental context. We combined the results of a global meta-analysis to quantify how biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating forests deviates from biodiversity values in reference old-growth forests, with structural equation modeling, to identify direct and indirect associations between socioeconomic, biophysical and ecological factors and deviation in biodiversity recovery at a landscape scale. Low deviation within a landscape means higher chances of multiple sites in naturally regenerating forests successfully recovering biodiversity compared to reference forests. Deviation in biodiversity recovery was directly negatively associated with the percentage of cropland, forest cover, and positively associated with the percentage of urban areas in the surrounding landscape. These three factors mediated the indirect associations with rural population size, recent gross deforestation, time since natural regeneration started, mean annual temperature, mean annual water deficit, road density, land opportunity cost, percentage cover of strictly protected forest areas, and human population variation in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that natural forest restoration should be prioritized in landscapes with both low socioeconomic pressures on land use conversion to pasturelands and urban areas, and high percentage of forest cover.},

	abstract = {The success of a scientist depends on their production of scientific papers and the impact factor of the journal in which they publish. Because most major scientific journals are published in English, success is related to publishing in this language. Currently, 98\% of publications in science are written in English, including researchers from English as a Foreign Language (EFL) countries. Colombia is among the countries with the lowest English proficiency in the world. Thus, understanding the disadvantages that Colombians face in publishing is crucial to reducing global inequality in science. This paper quantifies the disadvantages that result from the language hegemony in scientific publishing by examining the additional costs that communicating in English creates in the production of articles. It was identified that more than 90\% of the scientific articles published by Colombian researchers are in English, and that publishing in a second language creates additional financial costs to Colombian doctoral students and results in problems with reading comprehension, writing ease and time, and anxiety. Rejection or revision of their articles because of the English grammar was reported by 43.5\% of the doctoral students, and 33\% elected not to attend international conferences and meetings due to the mandatory use of English in oral presentations. Finally, among the translation/editing services reviewed, the cost per article is between one-quarter and one-half of a doctoral monthly salary in Colombia. Of particular note, we identified a positive correlation between English proficiency and higher socioeconomic origin of the researcher. Overall, this study exhibits the negative consequences of hegemony of English that preserves the global gap in science. Although having a common language is important for science communication, generating multilinguistic alternatives would promote diversity while conserving a communication channel. Such an effort should come from different actors and should not fall solely on EFL researchers.},

However, major research biases and knowledge shortfalls in some geographical regions, taxonomic groups and responses studied are recurrent in fragmentation-related research. Therefore, detecting these biases and associated gaps is crucial to steer future research efforts and to guide applicable conservation policies. Here we conducted an exhaustive literature review to evaluate biases on fragmentation research across biomes, taxonomic groups, species responses and fragmentation metrics in Brazil. Overall, we analysed 716 papers, comprising a database with 26 taxonomic groups and 1173 cases studied across the six Brazilian biomes. In general, we observed that fragmentation-related research was biogeographically biased towards forest biomes. Specifically, the Atlantic Forest, the most populated and deforested Brazilian biome, comprised the highest number of studies (63\%), while non-forest biomes were largely underrepresented. We also detected a high positive relative taxonomic bias for birds and mammals, while many insect taxa were disproportionately underrepresented in the literature. Altogether, assemblage-level species responses (abundance, diversity and richness) comprised 72\% of study cases. Moreover, fragment size was clearly the most considered metric in the studies (43\%) followed by habitat quality and edge effects. Our findings indicate major information deficits with regard to fragmentation-related research among taxonomic groups and amongst biomes in a megadiverse country. Therefore, we suggest that fragmentation research conducted in Brazil needs to consider undersampled taxa and to be urgently extended to increasingly degraded non-forest biomes in order to avoid inappropriate inferences.},

There is, however, little direct evidence of yield benefits from ecological intensification on commercial farms growing globally important foodstuffs (grains, oilseeds and pulses). We replicated two treatments removing 3 or 8\% of land at the field edge from production to create wildlife habitat in 50–60 ha patches over a 900 ha commercial arable farm in central England, and compared these to a business as usual control (no land removed). In the control fields, crop yields were reduced by as much as 38\% at the field edge. Habitat creation in these lower yielding areas led to increased yield in the cropped areas of the fields, and this positive effect became more pronounced over 6 years. As a consequence, yields at the field scale were maintained—and, indeed, enhanced for some crops—despite the loss of cropland for habitat creation. These results suggested that over a 5-year crop rotation, there would be no adverse impact on overall yield in terms of monetary value or nutritional energy. This study provides a clear demonstration that wildlife-friendly management which supports ecosystem services is compatible with, and can even increase, crop yields.},

	abstract = {Politicians have approved significant changes to the Brazilian Forest Code (Brazilian Law n. 12.651/2012), providing partial pardons for illegal deforestation in 2012. Nonetheless, the New Forest Code (NFC) may cause economic harm, since ecosystem services may be affected, and the productivity of several crops may end up decreasing. Here, we explored two sets of factors, one at a narrow-scale – the loss of close natural vegetation cover – and another at a wide-scale considering implications at a landscape level to measure the effects of the presence/absence of forest remnants, and consequently, of pollinators, on coffee productivity. The narrow-scale perspective used manipulative experiments in ten coffee plantations, and the wide-scale perspective considered secondary data on coffee productivity in planted and native forests of 61 municipalities to test the hypotheses: i) coffee branches with pollinator access are more productive; ii) coffee crops in contact with native forest remnants are more productive; iii) coffee plants located near to native forest remnants are more productive; iv) coffee productivity increases with the municipality area occupied by native forest remnants, and, v) coffee productivity decreases with the municipality area occupied by Eucalyptus spp. At the narrow-scale, we detected 32 \% higher coffee productivity when pollinators were present (hypothesis i) and 15 \% higher productivity when forest remnants were in contact with the plantation (hypothesis ii), but no differences related to forest remnants in the broader area (hypothesis iii). At the wide-scale, we observed that a higher amount of native forest cover increased coffee productivity (hypothesis iv), while increased Eucalyptus spp. plantations reduced coffee pro­ ductivity (hypothesis v). The corroboration of hypotheses i, ii, and iv illustrates the importance of animal pollination and native vegetation remnants fr coffee productivity. The findings for hypothesis v reinforce that Eucalyptus spp. plantations are not good surrogates for native vegetation as part of management recovery action for deforested areas. Following the New Forest Code’s recommendations in Article 22 (Chapter IV, Section II), the preservation of native vegetation, species diversity, and native species regeneration should be attended to in legally instituted natural reserves. Our findings improve discernment that natural areas’ devastation or its coverage using planted forest may reduce productivity levels of coffee plantations, representing a disruption of natural complexity, of organisms’ connectivity, and consequently of ecosystem services as the pollination and pollinator-dependent crops’ productivity, as the coffee.},

	abstract = {How can rapidly growing food demands be met with least adverse impact on nature? Two very different sorts of suggestions predominate in the literature: wildlife-friendly farming, whereby on-farm practices are made as benign to wildlife as possible (at the potential cost of decreasing yields); and land-sparing, in which farm yields are increased and pressure to convert land for agriculture thereby reduced (at the potential cost of decreasing wildlife populations on farmland). This paper is about one important aspect of the land-sparing idea – the sensitivity of future requirements for cropland to plausible variation in yield increases, relative to other variables. Focusing on the 23 most energetically important food crops, we use data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) to project plausible values for 2050 for population size, diet, yield, and trade, and then look at their effect on the area needed to meet demand for the 23 crops, for the developing and developed worlds in turn. Our calculations suggest that across developing countries, the area under those crops will need to increase very considerably by 2050 (by 23\% under intermediate projections), and that plausible variation in average yield has as much bearing on the extent of that expansion as does variation in population size or per capita consumption; future cropland area varies far less under foreseeable variation in the net import of food from the rest of the world. By contrast, cropland area in developed countries is likely to decrease slightly by 2050 (by 4\% under intermediate projections for those 23 crops), and will be less sensitive to variation in population growth, diet, yield, or trade. Other contentious aspects of the land-sparing idea require further scrutiny, but these results conﬁrm its potential signiﬁcance and suggest that conservationists should be as concerned about future agricultural yields as they are about population growth and rising per capita consumption.},

	abstract = {The restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of forests by 2030 are amongst the leading mitigation strategies for reducing carbon emissions within the Brazilian Nationally Determined Contribution targets assumed under the Paris Agreement. Understanding the dynamics of forest cover, which steeply decreased between 1985 and 2018 throughout Brazil, is essential for estimating the global carbon balance and quantifying the provision of ecosystem services. To know the long-term increment, extent, and age of secondary forests is crucial; however, these variables are yet poorly quantified. Here we developed a 30-m spatial resolution dataset of the annual increment, extent, and age of secondary forests for Brazil over the 1986–2018 period. Land-use and land-cover maps from MapBiomas Project (Collection 4.1) were used as input data for our algorithm, implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset provides critical spatially explicit information for supporting carbon emissions reduction, biodiversity, and restoration policies, enabling environmental science applications, territorial planning, and subsidizing environmental law enforcement.},

	abstract = {Extensive ecosystem restoration is increasingly seen as being central to conserving biodiversity1 and stabilizing the climate of the Earth2. Although ambitious national and global targets have been set, global priority areas that account for spatial variation in benefits and costs have yet to be identified. Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15\% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60\% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30\% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning. Our results confirm the vast potential contributions of restoration to addressing global challenges, while underscoring the necessity of pursuing these goals synergistically.},

Hopes for the simultaneous achievement of conservation goals and poverty alleviation are therefore increasingly placed on forests used for timber extraction. Most timber exploitation is carried out unsustainably, which causes forest degradation. Two important mechanisms have emerged to promote sustainable forest management: certification and community-based forest management (CFM). We synthesize the published information about how forest certification and CFM perform in terms of environmental, social, and economic variables. With the caveat that very few published studies meet the standards for formal impact evaluation, we found that certification has substantial environmental benefits, typically achieved at a cost of reduced short-term financial profit, and accompanied by some improvement to the welfare of neighboring communities. We found that the economic and environmental benefits of CFM are understudied, but that the social impacts are controversial, with both positive and negative changes reported. We identify the trade-offs that likely caused these conflicting results and that, if addressed, would help both CFM and certification deliver the hoped-for benefits.},

The tropics house around 50 million forest fragments and the length of the world’s tropical forest edges sums to nearly 50 million km. Edge effects in tropical forests have caused an additional 10.3 Gt (2.1–14.4 Gt) of carbon emissions, which translates into 0.34 Gt per year and represents 31\% of the currently estimated annual carbon releases due to tropical deforestation. Fragmentation substantially augments carbon emissions from tropical forests and must be taken into account when analysing the role of vegetation in the global carbon cycle.},

Through a review of country-level legislation, we found that just 38\% of countries have minimum area requirements for conserving native habitats within working landscapes. We argue for increasing native habitats to at least 20\% of working landscape area where it is below this minimum. Such target has benefits for food security, nature's contributions to people, and the connectivity and effectiveness of protected area networks in biomes in which protected areas are underrepresented. We also argue for maintaining native habitat at higher levels where it currently exceeds the 20\% minimum, and performed a literature review that shows that even more than 50\% native habitat restoration is needed in particular landscapes. The post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is an opportune moment to include a minimum habitat restoration target for working landscapes that contributes to, but does not compete with, initiatives for expanding protected areas, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {Brazil is the world’s leading coffee exporter, contributing billions of dollars to the global food economy. Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by ‘smallholders’, producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by ∼0.25 °C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20\% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country’s mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper investigates the incentives to coffee farmers to participate in certification schemes that require improved agricultural practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors ran a choice experiment among 250 Brazilian coffee farmers in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Findings: The authors’ findings show that both cash and non-cash payments are likely to incentive farmers' participation in a certification scheme. Besides price premium, incentives as long-term contracts and provision of technical would encourage producers to adopt eco-certification schemes. Our results also suggest that non-cash payments may be appropriate substitutes to a price premium to some extent. Research limitations/implications: The large coffee producers are over-represented in our sample compared to the population of Brazilian coffee farms. However, it seems reasonable to focus on these producers, as they are usually the ones who individually adopt strategies, since small farmers are induced by collective strategies (e.g. cooperatives). Social implications: The result regarding technical assistance makes sense given that Brazilian farmers generally have poor access to rural extension services. Originality/value: We contributed in the literature about adoption of sustainable agriculture practices analyzing the requirements and motivations for farmer participation in certification schemes. We also contribute private and public strategies to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In turn, the adoption of these systems may also involve investments in fixed capital and increases in operational costs, which create additional demand for rural credit. Other factors, such as access to extension policy, production scale, ex-ante perceptions, and market infrastructure also explain ICLS adoption. The access to rural credit policy is also determined by dependence on farm income, farmer’s perception of transaction costs, and supply of credit in the municipality.

	abstract = {Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (\%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (\%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (\%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.},

	abstract = {Reducing atmospheric CO2 is an international priority. One way to assist stabilising and reducing CO2 is to promote secondary tropical forest regrowth on abandoned agricultural land. However, relationships between above- and belowground carbon stocks with secondary forest age and specific soil nutrients remain unclear. Current global estimates for CO2 uptake and sequestration in secondary tropical forests focus on aboveground biomass and are parameterised using relatively coarse metrics of soil fertility. Here, we estimate total carbon stocks across a chronosequence of regenerating secondary forest stands (40–120 years old) in Panama, and assess the relationships between both above- and belowground carbon stocks with stand age and specific soil nutrients. We estimated carbon stocks in aboveground biomass, necromass, root biomass, and soil. We found that the two largest carbon pools – aboveground biomass and soil – have distinct relationships with stand age and soil fertility. Aboveground biomass contained {\textasciitilde}61–97 Mg C ha−1 (24–39\% total carbon stocks) and significantly increased with stand age, but showed no relationship with soil nutrients. Soil carbon stocks contained {\textasciitilde}128–206 Mg C ha−1 (52–70\% total stocks) and were unrelated to stand age, but were positively related to soil nitrogen. Root biomass carbon stocks tracked patterns exhibited by aboveground biomass. Necromass carbon stocks did not increase with stand age, but stocks were held in larger pieces of deadwood in older stands. Comparing our estimates to published data from younger and older secondary forests in the surrounding landscape, we show that soil carbon recovers within 40 years of forest regeneration, but aboveground biomass carbon stocks continue to increase past 100 years. Above- and belowground carbon stocks appear to be decoupled in secondary tropical forests. Paired measures of above- and belowground carbon stocks are necessary to reduce uncertainty in large-scale models of atmospheric CO2 uptake and storage by secondary forests.},

	abstract = {Ecologically relevant restoration of secondary Atlantic forest on abandoned land offers a potential means to recover biodiversity and improve crucial ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Early secondary successional trajectories are determined by a range of environmental factors that influence plant community development. Context-specific understanding of forest vegetation communities, their dynamics, and underlying drivers is needed for future restoration strategies. In this study we examined relationships between soil (chemical and physical) and environmental (landscape and topographical) characteristics, plant community attributes, and carbon stocks during early secondary succession. Data were collected at two sites undergoing early secondary succession in seasonally-dry Atlantic Forest (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). Both sites were previously used for pasture and abandoned at similar times, but showed differing vegetation communities. We found tree biomass and diversity and ecosystem carbon storage to be strongly positively related to the amount of surrounding forest, less steep slopes and clay soils, and negatively to the abundance of the shrub Leandra aurea. Soil carbon pools significantly increased with aboveground tree biomass. The only factor significantly affecting the metric of overall successional development (combining tree biomass and diversity) was total surrounding forest cover. Our findings suggest recovery of secondary forest and below- and aboveground carbon storage is limited by the amount of adjacent forest, some soil properties and dense shrub establishment down-regulating the succession process. Overall we offer evidence of potential to improve recovery of Atlantic forest with ecologically relevant seeding/planting programmes and selective shrub removal that could benefit ecosystem carbon storage.},

In elevations of 100 m (lowland), 400 m (submontane), and 1000 m (montane) four 1-ha plots were established, and above- (live and dead) and belowground (live and dead) biomass were determined. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations in each compartment were determined and used to convert biomass into carbon and nitrogen stocks. The carbon aboveground stock (CAGB) varied along the elevation range from approximately 110 to 150 Mg·ha−1, and nitrogen aboveground stock (NAGB), varied from approximately 1.0 to 1.9 Mg·ha−1. The carbon belowground stock (CBGB) and the nitrogen belowground stock (NBGB) were significantly higher than the AGB and varied along the elevation range from approximately 200–300 Mg·ha−1, and from 14 to 20 Mg·ha−1, respectively. Finally, the total carbon stock (CTOTAL) varied from approximately 320 to 460 Mg·ha−1, and the nitrogen total stock (NTOTAL) from approximately 15 to 22 Mg·ha−1. Most of the carbon and nitrogen stocks were found belowground and not aboveground as normally found in lowland tropical forests. The above- and belowground stocks, and consequently, the total stocks of carbon and nitrogen increased significantly with elevation. As the soil and air temperature also decreased significantly with elevation, we found a significantly inverse relationship between carbon and nitrogen stocks and temperature. Using this inverse relationship, we made a first approach estimate that an increase of 1°C in soil temperature would decrease the carbon and nitrogen stocks in approximately 17 Mg·ha−1 and 1 Mg·ha−1 of carbon and nitrogen, respectively.},

	abstract = {Aim To map and characterize anthropogenic transformation of the terrestrial biosphere before and during the Industrial Revolution, from 1700 to 2000. Location Global. Methods Anthropogenic biomes (anthromes) were mapped for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 using a rule-based anthrome classification model applied to gridded global data for human population density and land use. Anthropogenic transformation of terrestrial biomes was then characterized by map comparisons at century intervals. Results In 1700, nearly half of the terrestrial biosphere was wild, without human settlements or substantial land use. Most of the remainder was in a seminatural state (45\%) having only minor use for agriculture and settlements. By 2000, the opposite was true, with the majority of the biosphere in agricultural and settled anthromes, less than 20\% seminatural and only a quarter left wild. Anthropogenic transformation of the biosphere during the Industrial Revolution resulted about equally from land-use expansion into wildlands and intensification of land use within seminatural anthromes. Transformation pathways differed strongly between biomes and regions, with some remaining mostly wild but with the majority almost completely transformed into rangelands, croplands and villages. In the process of transforming almost 39\% of earth's total ice-free surface into agricultural land and settlements, an additional 37\% of global land without such use has become embedded within agricultural and settled anthromes. Main conclusions Between 1700 and 2000, the terrestrial biosphere made the critical transition from mostly wild to mostly anthropogenic, passing the 50\% mark early in the 20th century. At present, and ever more in the future, the form and process of terrestrial ecosystems in most biomes will be predominantly anthropogenic, the product of land use and other direct human interactions with ecosystems. Ecological research and conservation efforts in all but a few biomes would benefit from a primary focus on the novel remnant, recovering and managed ecosystems embedded within used lands.},

To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle, storing 45\% of terrestrial C and constituting the largest component of the terrestrial C sink. Despite their central importance to the global C cycle, their ecosystem-level C cycles are not as well-characterized as those of extra-tropical forests, and knowledge gaps hamper efforts to quantify C budgets across the tropics and to model tropical forest-climate interactions. To advance understanding of C dynamics of pantropical forests, we compiled a new database, the Tropical Forest C database (TropForC-db), which contains data on ground-based measurements of ecosystem-level C stocks and annual fluxes along with disturbance history. This database currently contains 3568 records from 845 plots in 178 geographically distinct areas, making it the largest and most comprehensive database of its type. Using TropForC-db, we characterized C stocks and fluxes for young, intermediate-aged, and mature forests. Relative to existing C budgets of extra-tropical forests, mature tropical broadleaf evergreen forests had substantially higher gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), their autotropic respiration (Ra) consumed a larger proportion ( 67\%) of GPP, and their woody stem growth (ANPPstem) represented a smaller proportion of net primary productivity (NPP, 32\%) or GPP ( 9\%). In regrowth stands, aboveground biomass increased rapidly during the first 20 years following stand-clearing disturbance, with slower accumulation following agriculture and in deciduous forests, and continued to accumulate at a slower pace in forests aged 20–100 years. Most other C stocks likewise increased with stand age, while potential to describe age trends in C fluxes was generally data-limited. We expect that TropForC-db will prove useful for model evaluation and for quantifying the contribution of forests to the global C cycle.

	abstract = {Approximately half of the tropical biome is in some stage of recovery from past human disturbance, most of which is in secondary forests growing on abandoned agricultural lands and pastures. Reforestation of these abandoned lands, both natural and managed, has been proposed as a means to help offset increasing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the potential of these forests to serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide in aboveground biomass and soils. A review of literature data shows that aboveground biomass increases at a rate of 6.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1 during the first 20 years of succession, and at a rate of 2.9 Mg ha−1 yr−1 over the first 80 years of regrowth. During the first 20 years of regrowth, forests in wet life zones have the fastest rate of aboveground carbon accumulation with reforestation, followed by dry and moist forests. Soil carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.41 Mg ha−1yr−1 over a 100-year period, and at faster rates during the first 20 years (1.30 Mg carbon ha−1 yr−1). Past land use affects the rate of both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. Forests growing on abandoned agricultural land accumulate biomass faster than other past land uses, while soil carbon accumulates faster on sites that were cleared but not developed, and on pasture sites. Our results indicate that tropical reforestation has the potential to serve as a carbon offset mechanism both above- and belowground for at least 40 to 80 years, and possibly much longer. More research is needed to determine the potential for longer-term carbon sequestration for mitigation of atmospheric CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Brazil uses taxes, subsidies, and blending mandates as policy instruments to manage and stabilize its transportation fuel markets. The fuel sector has been very dynamic in recent years due to frequent policy adjustments and variable market conditions. In this paper, we use a price endogenous economic simulation model to analyze the impacts of such policy adjustments under various challenging conditions in the global ethanol and sugar markets. Our analysis specifically focuses on Brazilian producers' supply responses, consumers' driving demand and fuel choice, ethanol trade, land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and social welfare. The model results show that (i) under a low ethanol blending rate, conventional vehicles would be driven significantly less while flex-fuel and ethanol-dedicated vehicles would not be affected significantly; (ii) lowering the fuel taxes adversely affects the competitiveness of sugarcane ethanol against gasoline blends, thus lowering producers' surplus; and (iii) while a reduction in fuel taxes is advantageous in terms of overall social welfare, it has serious environmental impacts by increasing the GHG emissions from transportation fuels consumed in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide eﬀorts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped ﬁve major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classiﬁcation levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratiﬁed random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture ﬁelds. We also identiﬁed that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.},

Overall, diversification enhances biodiversity, pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation without compromising crop yields. Practices targeting aboveground biodiversity boosted pest control and water regulation, while those targeting belowground biodiversity enhanced nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and water regulation. Most often, diversification practices resulted in win-win support of services and crop yields. Variability in responses and occurrence of trade-offs highlight the context dependency of outcomes. Widespread adoption of diversification practices shows promise to contribute to biodiversity conservation and food security from local to global scales.},

	abstract = {Farm certification is rapidly becoming a sine qua non for access to specialty coffee markets. At the centre of these changes are smallholder coffee producers, responsible for 80\% of global coffee production. Although rural households are known to depend on more than agricultural production alone, the literature on specialty coffee and certification has rather narrowly focused on coffee income and production. In this study, broader impacts are explicitly taken into account. Household income was decomposed into categories corresponding to specific income-generating activities and coffee income was broken down into price, yield and area effects. Results show that coffee certification encourages farmers to specialise in coffee production, increasing coffee income but not total household income, at least not in the short run. The time and effort required to attain the higher coffee income offered by certified production means farmers have to give up other activities. This substitution effect cancels out the income effect, such that there is no increase in total household income. The lack of an effect on total household income suggests the return to the additional labour effort required for certified coffee production is not higher than in other activities, questioning the benefits of certification for small-scale producers.},

	abstract = {Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10–60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50\% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60\% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US\$−1, respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.},

Area-based conservation efforts, which include both protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, are likely to extend and diversify. However, persistent shortfalls in ecological representation and management effectiveness diminish the potential role of area-based conservation in stemming biodiversity loss. Here we show how the expansion of protected areas by national governments since 2010 has had limited success in increasing the coverage across different elements of biodiversity (ecoregions, 12,056 threatened species, ‘Key Biodiversity Areas’ and wilderness areas) and ecosystem services (productive fisheries, and carbon services on land and sea). To be more successful after 2020, area-based conservation must contribute more effectively to meeting global biodiversity goals—ranging from preventing extinctions to retaining the most-intact ecosystems—and must better collaborate with the many Indigenous peoples, community groups and private initiatives that are central to the successful conservation of biodiversity. The long-term success of area-based conservation requires parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to secure adequate financing, plan for climate change and make biodiversity conservation a far stronger part of land, water and sea management policies.},

	abstract = {The formulation of a strategic plan for the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR; 87,892 km2) requires an objective and spatially explicit assessment of the representativeness of major habitat categories (surrogates for biodiversity) currently under protection. A GIS layer of statutory and non-statutory conservation areas was used, along with layers of many biological and physical features, to explore the configuration of conserved areas relative to key biological and physical indicators. Three analyses were performed. (1) Recursive partitioning, a classification-tree analysis technique, was used to contrast features of protected areas with non-protected areas. (2) The conservation status of 16 primary and 88 secondary Broad Habitat Units (BHUs; derived on the basis of topography, geology, homogeneous climatic zones, and floristic composition) was assessed in terms of prescribed conservation targets. (3) The extent to which protected areas are able to sustain ecological and evolutionary processes was explored by assessing the extent of spatial components of these processes for all conservation areas. About 20\% of the CFR is protected in some form of conservation area, mostly concentrated on sandstone substrates, and areas with high altitude and steep slopes. The reservation bias towards upland areas has seriously constrained representation of biodiversity pattern and processes. Most of the habitat diversity is poorly represented in the current conservation area system with only 9\% of the remaining primary BHUs in the lowlands conserved. However, almost 50\% of the Mountain Fynbos Complex is conserved (largely exceeding its conservation target). Spatial components of the ecological processes identified are poorly captured by the conservation area network although faunal and floral migration is possible in the uplands due to the strong spatial connectivity of the protected network.},

In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30\%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others.},

	abstract = {Honeybees Can't Do It Alone
The majority of food crops require pollination to set fruit with the honeybee providing a pollination workhorse, with both feral and managed populations an integral component of crop management (see the Perspective by Tylianakis, published online 28 February). Garibaldi et al. (p. 1608, published online 28 February) now show that wild pollinators are also a vital part of our crop systems. In more than 40 important crops grown worldwide, wild pollinators improved pollination efficiency, increasing fruit set by twice that facilitated by honeybees. Burkle et al. (p. 1611, published online 28 February) took advantage of one of the most thorough and oldest data sets available on plant-pollinator interaction networks and recollected data on plant-pollinator interactions after more than 120 years of climate change and landscape alteration. The historical data set consists of observations collected by Charles Robertson near Carlinville, Illinois (USA), in the late 1800s on the phenology of plants and their pollinating insects, as well as information about which plants and pollinators interacted with one another. Many sites were revisited in the early 1970s and in 2009 and 2010 to collect similar plant-pollinator data. Pollinator function has declined through time, with bees showing lower visitation rates and lower fidelity to individual plant species.
The diversity and abundance of wild insect pollinators have declined in many agricultural landscapes. Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14\% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.
Flower visits by wild insects enhanced fruit production in crops worldwide, well beyond the effect of bees. [Also see Perspective by Tylianakis]

A recent estimate showed that ecosystem services equal, on average, 33 trillion dollars a year, with pollination being responsible for 112 billions dollars. The alteration of natural systems and the loss of pollinating species have caused a decrease in many crops' productivity. The objective of this work is to evaluate the pollination as an ecological service in agriculture, testing the hypothesis that the presence of forest remnants increases coffee agricultural productivity through an increase in pollination. This argument is based on the assumption that areas of preservation of native forest required by Brazilian law provide pollinators to local agroecosystems. Fruit production was compared among three different planting regimes: agrosilviculture, and conventional monoculture with and without preserved forest remnants nearby. The average flower production by branch was different among the farms and was not related to the planting methods. The first flowering was larger than the second, representing 81–98\% of the flowers' total production. The farms near forest fragments had an increase of 14.6\% in production that can be related to the pollinating services.},

	abstract = {Pollination is an ecological process that provides important services to humans. Pollination service in agroecosystems depends on several factors, including the land management systems used by farmers. Here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of management systems in central Veracruz, Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact management systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high environmental impact management systems (the native forest is completely removed). We hypothesized that pollinator diversity should be higher in low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems should display higher fruit production than plantations with high-impact management systems. We used observational and experimental data to test this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management systems have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index) of pollinators than high-impact management systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively related with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover, fruit production was higher in low-impact than in high-impact management systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that such effects may have strong consequences on coffee fruit production.},

	abstract = {More-diverse pollinators improve crop yields
It is known that increased pollinator diversity can improve the yield of agricultural crops. However, how best to both produce food and maintain diversity is still debated. Garibaldi et al. show that on small farms, which provide food for the most vulnerable populations globally, pollinator diversity can significantly increase productivity. Thus, the management of crops and surrounding areas for ecological health is likely to benefit both wild pollinator populations and farmers.
Science, this issue p. 388
Ecological intensification, or the improvement of crop yield through enhancement of biodiversity, may be a sustainable pathway toward greater food supplies. Such sustainable increases may be especially important for the 2 billion people reliant on small farms, many of which are undernourished, yet we know little about the efficacy of this approach. Using a coordinated protocol across regions and crops, we quantify to what degree enhancing pollinator density and richness can improve yields on 344 fields from 33 pollinator-dependent crop systems in small and large farms from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. For fields less than 2 hectares, we found that yield gaps could be closed by a median of 24\% through higher flower-visitor density. For larger fields, such benefits only occurred at high flower-visitor richness. Worldwide, our study demonstrates that ecological intensification can create synchronous biodiversity and yield outcomes.
A large international data set confirms that increased diversity of wild pollinators increases crop yields.

	abstract = {Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it  provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

We documented the restoration of an estimated 673,510–740,555ha of native forests from 2011 to 2015 in the Atlantic Forest, and expect that a total of 1.35–1.48Mha will be under recovery by 2020. The Pact is one of the first Brazilian restoration initiatives to monitor an international restoration commitment and to demonstrate that ambitious targets can be reached. Part of this success in large-scale restoration is related to three main Pact activities: (i) development of restoration governance, communication and articulation; (ii) promotion of strategies to influence public policies; and (iii) establishment of restoration monitoring systems.

Here we take stock of the existing knowledge on key aspects necessary to support agroecological transitions in large scale farming, considering two contrasting starting points: highly subsidized and heavily taxed agricultural contexts, represented here by the examples of Western Europe and temperate South America. We summarize existing knowledge and gaps around service crops, arthropod-mediated functions, landscape and watershed regulation, graze-based livestock, nature conservation and policy mechanisms to support transitions. We finish with a research agenda for agroecology in large scale farming organized in five domains: (i) Breeding for diversity, (ii) Scalable complexity, (iii) Managing cycles beyond plots, (iv) Sharing the cultivated landscape, and (v) Co-innovation with farmers, value chain and policy makers.},

We show that 83−85\% of the surveys presented losses in forest biomass and tree species richness, functional traits, and conservation value. On average, forest fragments have 25−32\% less biomass, 23−31\% fewer species, and 33, 36, and 42\% fewer individuals of late-successional, large-seeded, and endemic species, respectively. Biodiversity and biomass erosion are lower inside strictly protected conservation units, particularly in large ones.

	abstract = {This study’s overarching aim is to establish the areal extent and characteristics of the rapid sugarcane expansion and land use change in São Paulo state (Brazil) as a result of an increase in the demand for ethanol, using Landsat type remotely sensed data. In 2003 flex fuel automobiles started to enter the Brazilian consumer market causing a dramatic expansion of sugarcane areas from 2.57 million ha in 2003 to 4.45 million ha in 2008. Almost all the land use change, for the sugarcane expansion of crop year 2008/09, occurred on pasture and annual crop land, being equally distributed on each. It was also observed that during the 2008 harvest season, the burned sugarcane area was reduced to 50\% of the total harvested area in response to a protocol that aims to cease sugarcane straw burning practice by 2014 for mechanized areas. This study indicates that remote sensing images have efficiently evaluated important characteristics of the sugarcane cultivation dynamic providing quantitative results that are relevant to the debate of sustainable ethanol production from sugarcane in Brazil.},

	abstract = {The Cerrado biome is Brazil's breadbasket and a major provider of ecosystem services, though these dual roles are increasingly at odds, in part because there are few mechanisms to protect remaining vegetation from large-scale agricultural expansion. We assessed Cerrado conversion to soy using over 580,000 property boundaries, covering 77\% of the biome that is eligible for commercial land use, and using microwatersheds, to cover 100\% of eligible areas. Soy expansion accounted for 22\% of conversion during 2003–14. Only 15\% of clearing exceeded restrictions on private properties under the Forest Code (FC). However, 51\% of soy farms have violated the FC, five times the rate of other farms. As a leading cause of both Cerrado conversion and FC violations, the soy sector has environmental and economic incentives to shift production to already cleared land. We used suitability maps to identify potential pathways for soy expansion across both old and new cropland frontiers.},

Reforestation is a potentially large-scale method for removing CO2 and storing it in the biomass and soils of ecosystems3–8, yet its cost per tonne remains uncertain6,9. Here, we produce spatially disaggregated marginal abatement cost curves for tropical reforestation by simulating the effects of payments for increased CO2 removals on land-cover change in 90 countries. We estimate that removals from tropical reforestation between 2020–2050 could be increased by 5.7 GtCO2 (5.6\%) at a carbon price of US \$20 CO2–1, or by 15.1 GtCO2 (14.8\%) at US\$50 tCO2–1. Ten countries comprise 55\% of potential low-cost abatement from tropical reforestation. Avoided deforestation offers 7.2–9.6 times as much potential low-cost abatement as reforestation overall (55.1 GtCO2 at US\$20 tCO2–1 or 108.3 GtCO2 at US\$50 tCO2–1), but reforestation offers more potential low-cost abatement than avoided deforestation at US\$20 tCO2–1 in 21 countries, 17 of which are in Africa.},

	abstract = {A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

	abstract = {Private sustainability standards cover an increasingly large production area and involve an increasing number of farmers worldwide. They raise expectations among consumers about the economic, ethical and environmental implications of food production and trade; and attract donor funding to certification schemes. The sustainability impact of standards remains unclear as research focuses on either economic or environmental implications. We analyze both the socio-economic and environmental impacts of coffee standards in Uganda and show that these are not in line with expectations created towards consumers. We find that standards improve either productivity and farm incomes or biodiversity and carbon storage but fail to eliminate trade-offs between socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, even when combined in multiple certification. Our analysis is based on a unique combination of economic survey data and ecological field inventory data from a sample of certified and non-certified coffee farms. Our findings are relevant for farmers, food companies, policy-makers, donors and consumers. They imply that combining different standards in multiple certification is counterproductive; that the design of standards could improve to mitigate observed trade-offs between economic and environmental outcomes; and that this requires increased productivity within ecological boundaries, rather than a price premium and added control mechanisms through multiple certification.},

	abstract = {Natural regeneration of forests has significantly led to increased native forest cover in some regions. Several studies have explored the spatial drivers of forest cover increase, yet little is known about their effects on forest structure and species richness and diversity. We quantified the effects of local (forest age, remnant Eucalyptus basal area, slope, soil fertility, and clay content) and landscape drivers (surrounding land use, distance from streams, and surrounding forest cover and its change over time) on the aboveground biomass, species density, and phylogenetic diversity of native trees in second-growth forests. We sampled 44 naturally regenerating forests established on former pastures and abandoned Eucalyptus plantations for 11–46 years in agricultural landscapes of the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed effect models to quantify the effect drivers on forest attributes. While only Eucalyptus basal area and proximity to sugarcane plantations had a consistent negative effect on forest biomass, other drivers were among the best models to explain forest attributes, but their effect was variable. Age increased tree biomass but the effect was not consistent. Similarly, species richness and phylogenetic diversity were mainly affected by landscape drivers such as surrounding forest cover. In tropical agricultural landscapes, effective forest recovery requires more than just time, as forest age can be less important in determining forest attributes than human land uses and surrounding native forest cover. Crucially, forest recovery can be improved through interventions and policies that promote less impactful human activities and enhance existing forest cover.

	abstract = {Aim It is widely accepted that biodiversity is influenced by both niche-related and spatial processes from local to global scales. Their relative importance, however, is still disputed, and empirical tests are surprisingly scarce at the global scale. Here, we compare the importance of area (as a proxy for pure spatial processes) and environmental heterogeneity (as a proxy for niche-related processes) for predicting native mammal species richness world-wide and within biogeographical regions. Location Global. Time period We analyse a spatial snapshot of richness data collated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Major taxa studied All terrestrial mammal species, including possibly extinct species and species with uncertain presence. Methods We applied a spreading dye algorithm to analyse how native mammal species richness changes with area and environmental heterogeneity. As measures for environmental heterogeneity, we used elevation ranges and precipitation ranges, which are well-known correlates of species richness. Results We found that environmental heterogeneity explained species richness relationships better than did area, suggesting that niche-related processes are more prevalent than pure area effects at broad scales. Main conclusions Our results imply that niche-related processes are essential to understand broad-scale species–area relationships and that habitat diversity is more important than area alone for the protection of global biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The future availability and quality of natural resources essential to life such as ecosystem services and biodiversity depend on the conservation and restoration of native vegetation. The Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL) requires farmers to conserve a minimum percentage of native vegetation within their properties as Legal Reserves (LR) as well as riparian forests and hilltops as Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs). To monitor the conservation and facilitate the compliance of these areas, the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) and the Environmental Regularization Program (PRA) were created. However, so far, little is known about farmers' interest in joining the PRA and the actions they intend to take to correct their past illegal deforestation. This article explores a unique dataset comprising of the individual answers of 97 thousand farmers in the states of Pará and Mato Grosso given to the Brazilian Forest Service in the process of joining at the national rural environmental registry system. We found that the adherence to the PRA is positively correlated with recognition of the LR deficit and the size of the rural property. Also medium and large landowners and crop producers tend to seek compliance by taking actions outside the farm (compensation), while small farmers and squatters are more likely to act inside their own areas (restoration). Understanding farmers’ interests and options for LR compliance can contribute for the formulation of more effective implementation strategies for PRA and NVPL.},

	abstract = {The awareness of the need for robust impact evaluations in conservation is growing and statistical matching techniques are increasingly being used to assess the impacts of conservation interventions. Used appropriately matching approaches are powerful tools, but they also pose potential pitfalls. We outlined important considerations and best practice when using matching in conservation science. We identified 3 steps in a matching analysis. First, develop a clear theory of change to inform selection of treatment and controls and that accounts for real-world complexities and potential spillover effects. Second, select the appropriate covariates and matching approach. Third, assess the quality of the matching by carrying out a series of checks. The second and third steps can be repeated and should be finalized before outcomes are explored. Future conservation impact evaluations could be improved by increased planning of evaluations alongside the intervention, better integration of qualitative methods, considering spillover effects at larger spatial scales, and more publication of preanalysis plans. Implementing these improvements will require more serious engagement of conservation scientists, practitioners, and funders to mainstream robust impact evaluations into conservation. We hope this article will improve the quality of evaluations and help direct future research to continue to improve the approaches on offer.},

We consider the relative likelihood these countries will achieve their restoration commitments. Across countries, the area committed to restoration increased with existing forest and plantation area, but was inversely related to development status, with less developed countries pledging more area. Restoration commitments are generally large (median: 2 million hectares) and will be challenging to meet without the wholesale transformation of food production systems. Indeed, one third of countries committed {\textgreater}10\% of their land area to restoration (maximum: 81\%). Furthermore, high rates of land cover change may reverse gains: a quarter of countries experienced recent deforestation and agricultural expansion that exceeded their restoration commitment area. The limited progress reported by countries, and the sheer scale of commitments, raises serious questions about long-term success, especially absent necessary monitoring and management plans.},

	abstract = {Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species’ biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world’s birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608–851 bird (6–9\%), 670–933 amphibian (11–15\%), and 47–73 coral species (6–9\%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower IPCC SRES emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and area-specific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {Restoration ecology has provided a suite of tools for accelerating the recovery of ecosystems damaged by drivers of global change. We review both the ecological and economic concepts developed in restoration ecology, and offer guidance on when, what, where, and how to restore ecosystems. For when to restore, we highlight the value of pursuing restoration early to prevent ecosystems from crossing tipping points and evaluating whether unassisted natural recovery is more cost-effective than active restoration. For what to restore, we encourage developing a restoration plan with stakeholders that will restore structural, compositional, and functional endpoints, and whose goal is a more resistant and resilient ecosystem. For where to restore, we emphasize developing restoration approaches that can address the impediment of rural poverty in the developing world and identifying and then balancing the ecosystems and regions in most need of restoration and those that are best positioned for restoration success. For the economics of how to restore ecosystems, we review the advantages and disadvantages of market-based strategies, such as environmental insurance bonds and Payment for Ecosystem Services frameworks, for funding, incentivizing, and ensuring restoration. For the ecology of how to restore ecosystems, we discuss the value of taking into account various ecological theories, site history, and landscape and aquascape perspectives, and employing a more inclusive toolbox that holistically considers alterations to propagule pressure, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions. Finally, we draw attention to the importance of monitoring; adaptive management; stakeholder involvement; collaborations among scientists, managers, and practitioners; formal evaluation throughout the restoration process; and integrating ecological and economic concepts to maximize restoration success. We hope this overview of key ecological and economic concepts in restoration science sheds light on the discipline and facilitates restoring and maintaining the services and products provided by natural capital, thus improving human livelihoods and hope for posterity.},

We ask whether Indonesia’s national anti-poverty program, which transfers cash to hundreds of thousands of poor households, reduced deforestation as a side benefit. Although the program has no direct link to conservation, we estimate that it reduced tree cover loss in villages by 30\% (95\% confidence interval, 10 to 50\%). About half of the avoided losses were in primary forests, and reductions were larger when participation density was higher. The economic value of the avoided carbon emissions alone compares favorably to program implementation costs. The program’s environmental impact appears to be mediated through channels widely available in developing nations: consumption smoothing, whereby cash substitutes for deforestation as a form of insurance, and consumption substitution, whereby market-purchased goods substitute for deforestation-sourced goods. The results imply that anti-poverty programs targeted at the very poor can help achieve global environmental goals under certain conditions.
Modest, but persistent, transfers of cash to extremely poor households can provide both social and environmental benefits.

We compare poverty across 36,311 villages between 2000 and 2018, tracking changes from before oil palm plantations were first established to several years after plantations were certified. Certification was associated with reduced poverty in villages with primarily market-based livelihoods, but not in those in which subsistence livelihoods were dominant before switching to oil palm. We highlight the importance of baseline village livelihood systems in shaping local impacts of agricultural certification and assert that oil palm certification in certain village contexts may require additional resources to ensure socioeconomic objectives are realized.},

	abstract = {The world's forests provide valuable contributions to people but continue to be threatened by agricultural expansion and other land uses. Counterfactual-based methods are increasingly used to evaluate forest conservation initiatives. This review synthesizes recent studies quantifying the impacts of such policies and programs. Extending past reviews focused on instrument choice, design, and implementation, our theory of change explicitly acknowledges context. Screening over 60,000 abstracts yielded 136 comparable normalized effect sizes (Cohen's d). Comparing across instrument categories, evaluation methods, and contexts suggests not only a lack of “silver bullets” in the conservation toolbox, but that effectiveness is also moderate on average. Yet context is critical. Many interventions in our sample were implemented in “bullet-proof” contexts of low pressure on natural resources. This greatly limits their potential impacts and suggests the need to invest further not only in understanding but also in better aligning conservation with local and global development goals.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that smallholder farms contribute substantially to food production globally yet spatially explicit data on agricultural field sizes are currently lacking. Automated field size delineation using remote sensing or the estimation of average farm size at subnational level using census data are two approaches that have been used but both have limitations, e.g. limited geographical coverage by remote sensing or coarse spatial resolution when using census data. This paper demonstrates another approach to quantifying and mapping field size globally using crowdsourcing. A campaign was run in June 2017 where participants were asked to visually interpret very high resolution satellite imagery from Google Maps and Bing using the Geo-Wiki application. During the campaign, participants collected field size data for 130K unique locations around the globe. Using this sample, we have produced an improved global field size map (over the previous version) and estimated the percentage of different field sizes, ranging from very small to very large, in agricultural areas at global, continental and national levels. The results show that smallholder farms occupy no more than 40\% of agricultural areas, which means that, potentially, there are much more smallholder farms in comparison with the current global estimate of 12\%. The global field size map and the crowdsourced data set are openly available and can be used for integrated assessment modelling, comparative studies of agricultural dynamics across different contexts and contribute to SDG 2, among many others.},

	abstract = {Humans have changed most of the terrestrial surface by changing land-use and land-cover. The spatial distribution and extent of land-cover changes have been studied and mapped widely, using remote sensing and geospatial technologies. Although there are numerous studies on the human decisions underlying such changes, they are limited to local case-studies. How such local-scale patterns of decision-making can be used to explain land-use change globally is unknown. Using a collection of local studies from a literature review, we studied the contextual conditions of different modes of land-use change decision-making and present global maps of the potential distribution of decision-making in land-use change. We find that decision-making in land-use can be explained, to a large extent, by the socio-economic, climatic and soil conditions of a location, captured by global data proxies of these conditions. Survival and livelihood objectives are positively associated to the spatial variation in childhood malnutrition and distance to roads, and negatively to total economic output of an area. Economic objectives on the other hand, are positively associated to total economic output, but also to the annual precipitation at the location. Similar trends are observed when looking at more detailed decision-making types: survivalist, subsistence-oriented and market-oriented smallholder decision-making types are more likely found in areas with higher poverty levels and overall lower levels of socio-economic development. The spatial distribution can be used to understand the occurrence of land-use intensification trajectories and to account for variation in decision-making in global land-use models. Finally, we provide a representation of the spread of case-studies and which contexts are poorly represented by case-studies.},

Reforestation has recently been identified as a promising nature-based climate solution. Yet there are context-dependent biophysical, financial, land-use and operational constraints to reforestation that demand careful consideration. Here, we show that 121 million ha of presently degraded land in Southeast Asia, a region noted for its significant reforestation potential, are biophysically suitable for reforestation. Reforestation of this land would contribute 3.43 ± 1.29 PgCO2e yr−1 to climate mitigation through 2030. However, by taking a combination of on-the-ground financial, land use and operational constraints into account, we find that only a fraction of that mitigation potential may be achievable (0.3–18\%). Such constraints are not insurmountable, but they show that careful planning and consideration are needed for effective landscape-scale reforestation.},

In this study we analysed the eﬀect of projected changes in climate on the area suitable for coﬀee production in 2050, and the potential of agroforestry systems to mitigate these eﬀects in a major coﬀee production region in southeast Brazil. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis with the bioclimatic model MaxEnt to explore the area that is suitable for coﬀee production in 2050 when coﬀee is grown in unshaded plantations and in agroforestry systems. The projected climate in 2050 was assessed using 19 global circulation models, and we accounted for the altered microclimate in agroforestry systems by adjusting the maximum and minimum air temperature. The climate models indicated that the annual mean air temperature is expected to increase 1.7 °C ± 0.3 in the study region, which will lead to almost 60 \% reduction in the area suitable for coﬀee production in unshaded plantations by 2050. However, the adoption of agroforestry systems with 50 \% shade cover can reduce the mean temperatures and maintain 75 \% of the area suitable for coﬀee production in 2050, especially between 600 and 800 m altitude. Our study indicates that major shifts in areas suitable for coﬀee production may take place within three decades, potentially leading to land conﬂicts for coﬀee production and nature conservation. Incentives that contribute to the development of coﬀee agroforestry systems at appropriate locations may be essential to safeguard coﬀee production in the southeast of Brazil.},

	abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important tropical crops on earth, considering both its gross production value and the number of families that depend on it for their livelihoods. Coffee also grows within some of the world’s most biodiverse habitats, in areas predicted to experience severe climate change impacts. Like many other crops, coffee benefits from several ecosystem services (ES) that provide important inputs or conditions for production. Given coffee’s strong interactions with conservation, livelihoods, and climate change, it is important to understand the roles of biodiversity-regulated ES to coffee and how they are likely to change under future climates. Here we review the available literature on the provision of two essential and interacting ES that regulate coffee production: control of a beetle pest by birds and pollination by bees. Studies show that bird and bee communities provide pest control and pollination services that improve coffee quantity and quality, benefiting coffee farmers whose livelihoods depend on this crop. The literature also shows that a variety of plot, farm, and landscape management practices that support resources for bees and birds can enhance these ES. We also evaluate how these ES and their interactions may change under future climate change. Several studies have estimated likely climate impacts on coffee per se, but few have investigated climate vulnerability of pollination and pest control ES. Even less studies have quantified interactions between these ES. Although evidence is incomplete, managing coffee farms as diversified agroforestry systems could improve climate resilience of coffee cropping and communities of birds and bees, and therefore help farming families adapt to their changing environment. Based on our review, we identify six critical research priorities in this active area of study. Filling knowledge gaps would advance our understanding of interactions among landscapes, ES, and climate change, and would support climate adaptation for the millions of households whose livelihoods depend on coffee.},

	abstract = {Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has gained international attention over the past decade, as manifested in both United Nations policy discussions and hundreds of voluntary projects launched to earn carbon-offset credits. There are ongoing discussions about whether and how projects should be integrated into national climate change mitigation efforts under the Paris Agreement. One consideration is whether these projects have generated additional impacts over and above national policies and other measures. To help inform these discussions, we compare the crediting baselines established ex-ante by voluntary REDD+ projects in the Brazilian Amazon to counterfactuals constructed ex-post based on the quasi-experimental synthetic control method. We find that the crediting baselines assume consistently higher deforestation than counterfactual forest loss in synthetic control sites. This gap is partially due to decreased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon during the early implementation phase of the REDD+ projects considered here. This suggests that forest carbon finance must strike a balance between controlling conservation investment risk and ensuring the environmental integrity of carbon emission offsets. Relatedly, our results point to the need to better align project- and national-level carbon accounting.},

Here we present a case study on FLR in the context of a global biodiversity hotspot – the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, using a participatory approach to include local stakeholders' knowledge and perception of the landscape into project planning. We analyzed the land use and cover, and organized a workshop with focus group methodology associated with maps and other visual representations to assess local’s perceptions of economic activities, production chains and their impacts on the landscape and ecosystem services. 10\% of the residents attended the workshop, mostly small and medium-scale landowners involved in agricultural activities. Most large-scale and cattle landowners do not live in the region, are not engaged in associations and few participated in the workshop, despite pastureland being the prominent land use in the analyzed region. The participants demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the territory, a disposition towards combining conservation with production practices, and a positive perception regarding ecotourism, agroecological approaches, water and soil conservation. The participatory approach proved effective to complement the initial assessment while revealing novel aspects of the landscape and the landowners, helping test our hypotheses and adjust the engaging narratives for future FLR activities planning in the region, including environmental law compliance. More studies associating social and natural science, including participatory methods and local communities’ perception, are needed to fully comprehend the drivers of stakeholders’ engagement. This case study provides useful insights for other researchers and practitioners to design more effective plans for future land management.},

Here we revisit this crucial comparison, synthesizing recent data from 62 sites worldwide. In 24 cases with economic estimates of services, conservation or restoration benefits (for example, greenhouse gas regulation, flood protection) tend to outweigh those private benefits (for example, profits from agriculture or logging) driving change to the alternative state. Net benefits rise rapidly with increasing social cost of carbon. Qualitative data from all 62 sites suggest that monetization of additional services would further increase the difference. Although conservation and restoration did not universally provide greater net value than the alternative state, across a large, geographically and contextually diverse sample, our findings indicate that at current levels of habitat conversion, conserving and restoring sites typically benefits human prosperity.},

	abstract = {Voluntary sustainability standards have expanded dramatically over the last decade. In the agricultural sector, such standards aim to ensure environmentally and socially sustainable production of a variety of commodity crops. However, little is known about where agricultural certification operates and whether certified lands are best located for conserving the world's most important biodiversity and benefiting the most vulnerable producers. To examine these questions we developed the first global map of commodity crop certification, synthesizing data from over one million farms to reveal the distribution of certification in unprecedented detail. It highlights both geographical clusters of certification as well as spatial bias in the location of certification with respect to environmental, livelihood and physical variables. Excluding organic certification, for which spatial data were not available, most certification of commodity crops is in tropical regions. Certification appears to be concentrated in areas important for biodiversity conservation, but not in those areas most in need of poverty alleviation, although there were exceptions to each of these patterns. We argue that the impact of sustainability standards could be increased by identifying places where it would be most beneficial to strengthen, consolidate, and expand certification. To achieve this, standards organizations will need to undertake more rigorous collection of spatial data, and more detailed analysis of their existing reach and impacts, with attention to potential trade-offs between different objectives. Efforts to promote spatial prioritization will require new partnerships to align specific conservation aims with the interests and capabilities of farmers.},

	abstract = {The idea that noncrop habitat enhances pest control and represents a win–win opportunity to conserve biodiversity and bolster yields has emerged as an agroecological paradigm. However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win–win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.},

Despite widespread societal concern about biodiversity loss associated with food production, consumers access to quantitative estimates of the impact of crop production on the world's species has been very limited compared to assessments of other environmental variables such as greenhouse gas emissions or water use. Here, we present a consistent dataset of the biodiversity footprints of pasture and 175 crops at the global and national level. The data were generated by combining maps of the global distribution of agricultural areas in the year 2000 with spatially explicit estimates of the biodiversity loss associated with the conversion of natural habitat to farmland. Estimates were derived for three common alternative measures of biodiversity – species richness, threatened species richness, and range rarity – of the world's mammals, birds, and amphibians. Our dataset provides important quantitative information for food consumers and policy makers, allowing them to take evidence-based decisions to reduce the biodiversity footprint of global food production.},

	abstract = {Agricultural systems have been continuously intensified to meet rising demand for agricultural products. However, there are increasing concerns that larger, more connected crop fields and loss of seminatural areas exacerbate pest pressure, but findings to date have been inconclusive. Even less is known about whether increased pest pressure results in measurable effects for farmers, such as increased insecticide use and decreased crop yield. Using extensive spatiotemporal data sampled every 2 to 3 d throughout five growing seasons in 373 cotton fields, we show that pests immigrated earlier and were more likely to occur in larger cotton fields embedded in landscapes with little seminatural area ({\textless}10\%). Earlier pest immigration resulted in earlier spraying that was further linked to more sprays per season. Importantly, crop yield was the lowest in these intensified landscapes. Our results demonstrate that both environmental conservation and production objectives can be achieved in conventional agriculture by decreasing field sizes and maintaining seminatural vegetation in the surrounding landscapes.},

	abstract = {Foreign investors have acquired approximately 90 million hectares of land for agriculture over the past two decades. The effects of these investments on local food security remain unknown. While additional cropland and intensified agriculture could potentially increase crop production, preferential targeting of prime agricultural land and transitions toward export-bound crops might affect local access to nutritious foods. We test these hypotheses in a global systematic analysis of the food security implications of existing land concessions. We combine agricultural, remote sensing, and household survey data (available in 11 sub-Saharan African countries) with georeferenced information on 160 land acquisitions in 39 countries. We find that the intended changes in cultivated crop types generally imply transitions toward energy-rich, but nutrient-poor, crops that are predominantly destined for export markets. Specific impacts on food production and access vary substantially across regions. Deals likely have little effect on food security in eastern Europe and Latin America, where they predominantly occur within agricultural areas with current export-oriented crops, and where agriculture would have both expanded and intensified regardless of the land deals. This contrasts with Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where deals are associated with both an expansion and intensification (in Asia) of crop production. Deals in these regions also shift production away from local staples and coincide with a gradually decreasing dietary diversity among the surveyed households in sub-Saharan Africa. Together, these findings point to a paradox, where land deals can simultaneously increase crop production and threaten local food security.},

	abstract = {Biological sources of carbon sequestration such as revegetation have been highlighted as important avenues to combat climate change and meet global targets by the global community including the Paris Climate Agreement. However, current and projected carbon prices present a considerable barrier to broad-scale adoption of tree planting as a key mitigation strategy. One avenue to provide additional economic and environmental incentives to encourage wider adoption of revegetation is the bundling or stacking of additional co-beneficial ecosystem services that can be realised from tree planting. Using the World’s largest land based carbon credit trading scheme, the Australian Emissions Reduction Scheme (ERF), we examine the potential for three pairs of ecosystem services, where the carbon sequestration value of land use change is paired with an additional co-benefit with strong prospects for local tangible benefits to land owners/providers. Two cases consider agricultural provisioning values that can be realised by the landowners in higher returns: increased pollination services and reduced lamb mortality. The third case examined payments for tree plantings along riparian buffers, with payments to farmers by a water utility who realises the benefit from reduced treatment cost due to water quality improvements. Economic incentives from these co-benefit case studies were found to be mixed, with avoided treatment costs from water quality paired with carbon payments the most promising, while pollination and reduced lamb mortality paired with carbon payments were unable to bridge the economic gap except under the most optimistic assumptions. We conclude that the economics case for significant land use change are likely to be geographically dispersed and only viable in relatively niche landscape positions in high establishment, high opportunity cost areas even when carbon payments are augmented with the value of co-benefits classified as providing direct and local benefits.},

In this study, we provide a wall-to-wall subnational map of the origin and supply chain of Brazilian meat, offal, and live cattle exports from 2015 to 2017, a trade worth more than \$5.4 billion/year. Brazil is the world’s largest beef exporter, exporting approximately one-fifth of its production, and the sector has a notable environmental footprint, linked to one-fifth of all commodity-driven deforestation across the tropics. By combining official per-shipment trade records, slaughterhouse export licenses, subnational agricultural statistics, and data on the origin of cattle per slaughterhouse, we mapped the flow of cattle from more than 2,800 municipalities where cattle were raised to 152 exporting slaughterhouses where they were slaughtered, via the 204 exporting and 3,383 importing companies handling that trade, and finally to 152 importing countries. We find stark differences in the subnational origin of the sourcing of different actors and link this supply chain mapping to spatially explicit data on cattle-associated deforestation, to estimate the “deforestation risk” (in hectares/year) of each supply chain actor over time. Our results provide an unprecedented insight into the global trade of a deforestation-risk commodity and demonstrate the potential for improved supply chain transparency based on currently available data.},

Brazil’s ‘Forest Code’ is a key tool to reconcile environmental preservation and agricultural production; it limits deforestation and requires forest restoration in illegally deforested areas. However, not all provisions of the law’s 2012 revision have yet been implemented and some are facing new challenges. Using modelled land use change projections for the whole of the country, we show that full implementation and enforcement of the law has the potential to contribute to conserving biodiversity. Biodiversity outcomes will be especially positive if (i) deforested areas are restored in ways that support recolonization by native species and (ii) additional measures are implemented to protect native vegetation in areas like Caatinga dry forests and Cerrado savannas, which may experience added pressure displaced from other regions by Forest Code implementation.},

Such initiatives must be able to augment the amount and the quality of remaining natural habitats. There is thus a growing need for long-term, multi-stakeholder and multi-purpose initiatives that result in multiple ecological and socioeconomic benefits at the biome scale. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) is a coalition of 260+ stakeholders, including governmental agencies, private sector, NGOs and research institutions, aimed at restoring 15 million ha of degraded and deforested lands by 2050. By articulating, and then integrating common interests, this initiative has allowed different sectors of society to implement an ambitious vision and create a forum for public and private concerns regarding forest restoration. The AFRP adopts a set of governance tools so multiple actors can implement key processes to achieve long-term and visionary restoration goals. Having overcome some initial challenges, AFRP now has to incorporate underrepresented stakeholders and enhance its efforts to make forest restoration more economically viable, including cases where restoration could be less expensive and profitable. The AFRP experience has resulted in many lessons learned, which can be shared to foster similar initiatives across tropical regions.},

We quantified native forest cover dynamics on an annual basis from 1990 to 2017 in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. Despite the relative stability of native forest cover during this period ({\textasciitilde}28 Mha), the ongoing loss of older native forests, mostly on flatter terrains, have been hidden by the increasing gain of younger native forest cover, mostly on marginal lands for mechanized agriculture. Changes in native forest cover and its spatial distribution increased forest isolation in 36.4\% of the landscapes. The clearance of older forests associated with the recut of 27\% of younger forests has resulted in a progressive rejuvenation of the native forest cover. We highlight the need to include native forest spatiotemporal dynamics into restoration programs to better estimate their expected benefits and unexpected problems.

	abstract = {The Amazon Fund is the world's largest program to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), funded with over US \$1b donated by Norway and Germany between 2008 and 2017 to reward Brazil for prior deforestation reductions. Olhos D'Água da Amazônia is cited as a leading project success − with over one thousand small-to-medium-sized crop and livestock producers in the municipality of Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso State receiving more from the Amazon Fund than all but two other municipalities. To secure property rights, aid environmental planning, and raise farmers' productivity and output diversity, the project helped farmers register in Brazil's environmental cadaster and receive property certificates. Furthermore, Olhos D'Água supported milk and honey production and paid farmers to conserve riverine forest sites. We estimate causal effects of Olhos D'Água, versus a counterfactual estimate of what would have happened without the project, using a synthetic-control method. We build from the pool of blacklisted municipalities weighted averages (synthetic controls) that best match pre-treatment outcomes for Alta Floresta. Project effects are estimated as post-treatment differences between Alta Floresta and the synthetic controls. We find that the project increased new CAR registrations, and INCRA certifications, and may have moderately increased honey and milk production. Alta Floresta's annual forest losses remained historically low but we find no clear causal effect of the project on deforestation rates. Our results support that rigorous impact evaluation can motivate and guide project improvements.},

	abstract = {Conventional agriculture is a significant driver of ecosystem service loss. In contrast, agroforestry is a land use option that can restore ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration. Using field data from small proprieties we aimed to quantify carbon sequestration and its potential economic impact in coffee agroforestry systems (CAS) in Brazil. Allometric equations were used to estimate carbon stock and tree biomass, while net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period were used as economic feasibility parameters in a 16-year modeled scenario. Discount rate and carbon price applied was 6\% and US\$ 5.1 Mg CO2e-1, respectively. Total mean carbon stock in two years old and 16 years old CAS were 1.38 ± 0.63 Mg C ha-1 and 59.69 ± 32.63 Mg C ha-1, respectively. All CAS presented payback periods of two years, with a mean NPV of US\$ 50,585.91 and a mean IRR of 89.93\%. Carbon revenue impact on NPV and IRR was US\$ 148.80 and 0.24\%, respectively. Our results indicate that carbon sequestration economic impact does not encourage the adoption of coffee agroforestry systems. However, these systems can be an economically viable land use option that sequester large amounts of carbon comparable to forest patches.},

	title = {Time, space, place, and the {Bonn} {Challenge} global forest restoration target},
	abstract = {The Bonn Challenge, a global effort to begin restoring 350 million hectares of degraded forest landscapes by 2030, was launched in 2011. To date countries have committed to restore more than 60 million hectares as part of the Bonn Challenge. As global decision-makers, governments, and communities join the effort to restore degraded land, new questions about the economics of restoration have emerged. Critics argue that restoration takes too long, costs too much, and produces too few benefits to justify public or private expenditures. This paper addresses these concerns by presenting a methodology for valuing the net benefits of large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives by estimating the net benefit of achieving the Bonn Challenge. This paper also estimates the net benefit of achieving the Bonn Challenge restoration target under different social discounting regimes, different valuations of public goods, and different time horizons to see how they affect the argument for investing society’s scarce resources in restoration. The results suggest that achieving the Bonn Challenge would generate a net benefit of between U.S.\$0.7 and U.S.\$9 trillion. The results show that restoration can create benefits that exceed its costs and that the value of these benefits might differ depending on the discount rate. The results show that lower social discount rates correspond to higher restoration rates. This suggests that the Bonn Challenge target is more likely to be met when a low social discount rate is used to discount the benefits and costs of restoration.},

	abstract = {In her News Focus story “Predators in the 'hood” (20 September, p. [1332][1]), V. Morell reported that top predator populations are coming back across much of North America. Meanwhile, predators in Brazil continue to decline. A recent meeting of wildlife experts indicated that the Atlantic rainforest that once stretched along the coast of Brazil and parts of Argentina and Paraguay may soon be the first tropical biome to lose its largest top predator, the jaguar ( Panthera onca ). Researchers estimated fewer than 250 mature jaguars alive in the entire biome, distributed in eight isolated populations ([ 1 ][2]). Even worse, molecular analyses demonstrate that local effective population size (a critical parameter for the maintenance of genetic diversity) is below 50 animals ([ 2 ][3]).

Jaguars are persecuted for their potential impact on livestock, and their prey have been overhunted even in large protected areas ([ 3 ][5]). Jaguars provide a crucial service in controlling herbivores (capybaras, deer, and peccaries) and smaller predators (pumas, ocelots, foxes, and racoons), and their overall extinction will likely disrupt predator-prey interactions with unpredictable effects on ecosystem function ([ 4 ][6]). The Atlantic rainforest is a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot, with less than 12\% of the original area left ([ 5 ][7]). Although 24\% of the remaining areas are large enough to support jaguars, jaguar populations can be found in only 7\% of the rainforest ([ 4 ][6]).

Population supplementation and reintroduction programs may provide new hope for jaguars, but uncontrolled hunting of jaguars and their prey is still widespread in most protected areas, threatening the persistence of this important top predator. In the absence of effective protection and management, the fate of the largest predator of the Atlantic forests is bleak.

	abstract = {Land-reform and environmental movements, revitalized by the democratization of civil society in Brazil in the 1990s, found their objectives in conflict over forested parcels that settlers want for conversion to agriculture but that are important for wildlife conservation. In the Atlantic Forest, where 95\% of the forest is gone, we reviewed three cases of Brazilian nongovernmental organization (NGOs) engagement with the landreform movement with respect to forest remnants neighboring protected areas that have insufficient habitat for the long-term survival of unique endangered species. In the Pontal do Paranapanema (Sa˜o Paulo), Po¸co das Antas (Rio de Janeiro), and southern Bahia, environmental NGOs have supported agricultural alternatives that improve livelihood options and provide incentives for habitat conservation planning. Where land-reform groups were better organized, technical cooperation on settlement agriculture permitted the exploration of mutual interests in conciliating the productive landscape with conservation objectives. Processes of regular consultation among NGOs, environmental agencies, and the private sector revealed that there was less zerosum conflict over the same lands than commonly perceived. In both groups, technicians found forested lands less suitable for small-scale agriculture, and leaders took risks to justify and support claims to alternative existing agricultural lands. Based on the cases we examined, the construction of landscapes with both forest stewardship and poverty-reducing agrarian reform faces continued obstacles from contradictory agrarian and environmental sector policies and inadequate economic incentives for forest stewardship on private lands.},

	abstract = {Biological sources of carbon sequestration such as revegetation have been highlighted as important avenues to combat climate change and meet global targets by the global community including the Paris Climate Agreement. However, current and projected carbon prices present a considerable barrier to broad-scale adoption of tree planting as a key mitigation strategy. One avenue to provide additional economic and environmental incentives to encourage wider adoption of revegetation is the bundling or stacking of additional co-beneficial ecosystem services that can be realized from tree planting. Using the World's largest land-based carbon credit trading scheme, the Australian Emissions Reduction Scheme (ERF), we examine the potential for three pairs of ecosystem services, where the carbon sequestration value of land use change is paired with an additional co-benefit with strong prospects for local tangible benefits to land owners/providers. Two cases consider agricultural provisioning values that can be realized by the landowners in higher returns: increased pollination services and reduced lamb mortality. The third case examined payments for tree plantings along riparian buffers, with payments to farmers by a water utility who realizes the benefit from reduced treatment cost due to water quality improvements. Economic incentives from these co-benefit case studies were found to be mixed, with avoided treatment costs from water quality paired with carbon payments the most promising, while pollination and reduced lamb mortality paired with carbon payments were unable to bridge the economic gap except under the most optimistic assumptions. We conclude that the economics case for significant land use change are likely to be geographically dispersed and only viable in relatively niche landscape positions in high establishment, high opportunity cost areas even when carbon payments are augmented with the value of co-benefits classified as providing direct and local benefits.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed a considerable increase in Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)—programmes that exchange value for land management practices intended to provide or ensure ecosystem services—with over 550 active programmes around the globe and an estimated US\$36–42 billion in annual transactions. PES represent a recent policy instrument with often very different programmes operating at local, regional and national levels. Despite the growth of these programmes, comprehensive and reliable data have proven difficult to find. This Analysis provides an assessment of the trends and current status of PES mechanisms—user-financed, government-financed and compliance—across the domains of water, biodiversity, and forest and land-use carbon around the world. We report the various dimensions of growth over the past decade (number of programmes, geographical spread, dollar value) to understand better the range of PES mechanisms over time and to examine which factors have contributed to or hindered growth. Four key features stand out for scaling up PES: motivated buyers, motivated sellers, metrics and low-transaction-cost institutions.},

	abstract = {A B S T R A C T Landscape transformation due to agriculture affects more than 40\% of the planet's land area and is the most important driver of losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) worldwide. Ecological restoration may significantly reduce these losses, but its effectiveness has not been systematically assessed in agroecosystems at the global level. We quantitatively meta-analyzed the results of 54 studies of how restoration actions reflecting the two contrasting strategies of land sparing and land sharing affect levels of biodiversity and ES in a wide variety of agroecosystems in 20 countries. Restoration increased overall biodiversity of all organism types by an average of 68\%. It also increased the supply of many ES, in particular the levels of supporting ES by an average of 42\% and levels of regulating ES by an average of 120\% relative to levels in the pre-restoration agroecosystem. In fact, restored agroecosystems showed levels of biodiversity and supporting and regulating ES similar to those of reference ecosystems. Recovery levels did not correlate with the time since the last restoration action. Comparison of land sparing and land sharing as restoration strategies showed that while both were associated with similar biodiversity recovery, land sparing led to higher median ES response ratios. Passive and active restoration actions did not differ significantly in the levels of biodiversity or ES recovery. Biodiversity recovery positively correlated with ES recovery. We conclude that ecological restoration of agroecosystems is generally effective and can be recommended as a way to enhance biodiversity and supply of supporting and regulating ES in agricultural landscapes. Whether a land sharing or land sparing strategy is preferable remains an open question, and might be case dependent. Moreover, it is unclear whether crop production on restored land can meet future food production needs. ã},

	abstract = {In tropical regions, the extent of agricultural land is rapidly increasing at the expense of natural forest with associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Agroforestry has long been proposed as a more sustainable agricultural system, conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, while providing significant local livelihood. In this context, cacao and coffee agroforestry is often regarded as more compatible with conservation of ecosystem integrity than cacao and coffee plantations. Using meta-analytical techniques and mixed models on data from 74 studies conducted across Africa, Latin America and Asia, a global quantitative synthesis was performed to assess the impact on biodiversity and on ecosystem services of (i) the conversion of natural forest into cacao and coffee agroforestry and (ii) the further intensification of agroforest into cacao and coffee plantation. Forest species richness and total species richness were significantly lower in the more intensively managed than in the more natural land use categories. Response ratios showed that the decline in total species richness was higher when comparing agroforest with plantation (−46\%), than when comparing forest with agroforest (−11\%). Biodiversity responses to intensification differed between Asia and Latin America, and between different species groups. Response ratios showed that management intensification decreased provision of ecosystem services with 37\% when comparing forest with agroforest and with 27\% when comparing agroforest with plantation. Our data suggest that species richness decline follows a concave yield function whereas ecosystem service decline follows a more convex yield function. Finally, we identified knowledge gaps related to a conspicuous lack of studies in Africa, and a general underreporting of ecosystem services and environmental variables related to agricultural intensification.},

	abstract = {Given that few ecosystems on the Earth have been unaffected by humans, restoring them holds great promise for stemming the biodiversity crisis and ensuring ecosystem services are provided to humanity. Nonetheless, few studies have documented the recovery of ecosystems globally or the rates at which ecosystems recover. Even fewer have addressed the added benefit of actively restoring ecosystems versus allowing them to recover without human intervention following the cessation of a disturbance. Our meta-analysis of 400 studies worldwide that document recovery from large-scale disturbances, such as oil spills, agriculture and logging, suggests that though ecosystems are progressing towards recovery following disturbances, they rarely recover completely. This result reinforces conservation of intact ecosystems as a key strategy for protecting biodiversity. Recovery rates slowed down with time since the disturbance ended, suggesting that the final stages of recovery are the most challenging to achieve. Active restoration did not result in faster or more complete recovery than simply ending the disturbances ecosystems face. Our results on the added benefit of restoration must be interpreted cautiously, because few studies directly compared different restoration actions in the same location after the same disturbance. The lack of consistent value added of active restoration following disturbance suggests that passive recovery should be considered as a first option; if recovery is slow, then active restoration actions should be better tailored to overcome specific obstacles to recovery and achieve restoration goals. We call for a more strategic investment of limited restoration resources into innovative collaborative efforts between scientists, local communities and practitioners to develop restoration techniques that are ecologically, economically and socially viable.},

As ecological restoration positively affects the structure and function of degraded ecosystems, understanding to what extent restoration recovers ecosystem services (ES) is an important step in directing large-scale restoration actions. We evaluated the effect of restoration in increasing the provision of ES in tropical forests. We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture, restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the degradation of tropical forests. These results should be considered for large-scale conservation and management efforts for this biome.},

Here we synthesize the current consensus on landscape approaches. This is based on published literature and a consensus-building process to define good practice and is validated by a survey of practitioners. We find the landscape approach has been refined in response to increasing societal concerns about environment and development tradeoffs. Notably, there has been a shift from conservation-orientated perspectives toward increasing integration of poverty alleviation goals. We provide 10 summary principles to support implementation of a landscape approach as it is currently interpreted. These principles emphasize adaptive management, stakeholder involvement, and multiple objectives. Various constraints are recognized, with institutional and governance concerns identified as the most severe obstacles to implementation. We discuss how these principles differ from more traditional sectoral and project-based approaches. Although no panacea, we see few alternatives that are likely to address landscape challenges more effectively than an approach circumscribed by the principles outlined here.},

Conference of the Parties 21 (COP21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP12 of the Convention on Biological Diversity should help foster support for vastly increased investment in the better management and restoration of natural capital. Large-scale restoration demonstrably improves ecological functioning to sustain both biodiversity and human well-being. However, much progress is needed to improve the effectiveness and cost efficiency of any restoration. The ecosystem services concept provides a framework for identifying the types of restorative interventions needed to target different forms and degrees of degradation, and achieve goals related to both ecosystem health and delivery of services to people. Moreover, it can strengthen the argument for, and planning of, large-scale restoration and conservation of natural capital. We use case studies from four continents to help demonstrate how the interconnection between ecological restoration and the ecosystem services concept is being utilized in land-use planning and enlightened ecosystem management. We offer ways in which this relationship can be better understood and communicated to support the scaling up of restoration activities to the landscape and regional scales across the full spectrum of land uses and ecosystem types.},

We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.},

	abstract = {Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.},

Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat, (4) natural habitat is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by natural habitat. In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of natural habitat for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining natural habitat.},

	abstract = {Environmental policies that require native vegetation conservation can be challenging to implement, especially in productive agricultural landscapes. In Brazil, the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law mandates ‘Legal Reserves’, protected native vegetation that landowners must retain on their properties. If landowners do not have the required minimum amount of native vegetation on their properties (the Legal Reserve ‘target’), they must either restore vegetation on the same property to meet the target, or compensate by protecting existing vegetation or restoring it on another property, ideally in ecologically equivalent areas. Here, we evaluate how different strategies (on-site/off-site protection and/or restoration), and different requirements for ecological equivalence when off-site strategies are used, affect the ability to achieve Legal Reserve targets, while minimising the need to restore native vegetation on productive farmland. We used a novel iterative tool to build scenarios that reflect different combinations of strategies to meet the minimum conservation target under different requirements for ecological equivalence, and compared their ability to achieve the target and their likely cost. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome where it was not possible to achieve the Legal Reserve target by protection of existing native vegetation, even when ecological equivalence rules were relaxed. As a consequence, vegetation restoration is required in this biome. Directing this required restoration to pasturelands that are less-suitable for agriculture allowed the target to be achieved in all states of Brazil, as long as only minimal ecological equivalence was required; however, for most states, the need to restore native vegetation on productive areas on farmlands could still be avoided while requiring medium to high ecological equivalence. These findings show the potential for moderate ecological equivalence to be achieved across most of Brazil in a cost-effective way and without impairing productive lands when seeking to meet the Legal Reserve targets.},

	abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have paramount importance with regards to hydrological and ecological functions. Despite such importance in terms of water provision, they are one of the most endangered ecosystems on the planet. One important topic that is still unclear is related to TMCF regeneration: can it recover the hydrological function of such critical ecosystems? In the present paper, the hydrological effects of the natural regeneration of TMCF were examined. We selected three catchments with different degrees of TMCF, and we examined the relationship between the amount of TMCF over time and hydrological variables such as water yields and baseflow using a time series (1984–2011). Our results suggest that the increase in TMCF cover can contribute to increases in water yield. This pattern was found in a catchment with an increase of approximately 20\% of forest cover. In catchments with TMCF increase lower than this threshold, water yield and flow path were influenced by hydroclimatic variables such as air temperature and rainfall. The effect of the reduction in water yield, in accordance with the increase in mean temperature, sheds light on possible consequences of climate change on ecosystem services produced in foggy environments. In light of these findings, aiming to increase the water yield, we recommend that regions frequently affected by fog are prioritized for forest restoration or conservation. To ensure significant effects, regeneration and/or successional development of TMCF has to reach at least 20\% of a catchment area.},

This review develops an analytic framework to characterize the fulfilment of these objectives by documenting the co-occurrence of positive, neutral, and negative outcomes for crop yield and nine regulating ecosystem services. We provide an illustrative examination of the framework, evaluating evidence for yield and ecosystem service outcomes across five AEI systems: conservation agriculture, holistic grazing management, organic agriculture, precision agriculture, and system of rice intensification (SRI). We reviewed 104 studies containing 245 individual comparisons between AEI and contrasting farming systems. In three of the five AEI systems, conservation agriculture, precision agriculture, and SRI, more than half of reviewed comparisons reported ‘win-win’ outcomes, enhancement of both yield and ecosystem services, or ‘win-neutral’ outcomes relative to contrasting farming systems. The review presents substantial evidence that the five AEI systems can contribute to multi-functional agriculture by increasing ecosystem service provision, or reducing negative externalities associated with agriculture, while maintaining or increasing yields. A framework such as the one presented here can help guide decision-makers considering how best to implement multi-functional agriculture so that both crop yield and ecosystem service delivery can be maintained or increased.},

	abstract = {This paper compares financial and biodiversity performance of small-scale shaded coffee and cocoa plantations versus intensified conventional ones. We conduct a meta-analysis including 23 studies on coffee and cocoa plantations over a 26year period. Our results show that, contrary to common perceptions, profitability and cost-efficiency are higher for small-scale shaded systems. Despite the lower yields for shaded systems, the lower costs per area and higher price per kilogram of coffee or cocoa causes shaded systems to perform better financially. This finding shows that the traditional indicator ‘yield’ is an inaccurate measure of financial performance when studying diversified systems, and that the more detailed indicators as net revenue or benefit-cost ratio should be used instead. Few studies specifically reported on the relationship between biodiversity and financial performance, providing divergent results, yet various papers showed a promising optimum relationship for intermediate levels of shade. Because shaded systems are known to correlate positively with biodiversity, we postulate that they can offer competitive business opportunities for small-scale farmers, while also contributing to biodiversity conservation. Still, there is a pressing need for multidisciplinary studies to quantify financial and biodiversity performance simultaneously, and to identify opportunities for scaling up shaded systems.},

	abstract = {The land-sharing versus land-sparing debate recently stagnated, lacking an integrating perspective in agricultural landscapes as well as consideration of ecosystem services. Here, we argue that land-sharing (i.e. wildlife-friendly farming systems) and land-sparing (i.e. separation of high-yielding agriculture and natural habitats) are not mutually exclusive, as both are needed to balance management needs for the multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. Land-sharing promotes ecosystem services in agricultural settings, thereby allowing for environmentally friendly production. Land set aside in protected areas by land-sparing is crucial for conservation of those species that are incompatible with agriculture. Importantly, as species move throughout the landscape and exploit different habitats, increased connectivity between environmentally friendly managed and protected areas is needed to (a) promote spillover of ecosystem service providers from land-sharing/-sparing measures to agricultural production and rescue service-providing species from extinction in hostile areas, (b) to facilitate immigration and counteract possible extinctions in spared habitats and (c) to conserve response diversity of species communities for ensuring resilience of ecosystem services in changing environments. In conclusion, the successful management of multifunctional landscapes requires the combination of context-specific land-sharing and land-sparing measures within spatially well-connected landscape mosaics, resulting in land-sharing/-sparing connectivity landscapes.

The objective of this work was to develop high-resolution grids (0.25∘ × 0.25∘) of daily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the five climate variables generally required to estimate evapostranspiration for Brazil. These five variables are maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. We tested six different interpolation schemes to create the grids for these variables. The data were obtained from 3625 rain gauge and 735 weather stations for period of 1980–2013. We used a cross-validation approach that compares point observed data to point interpolated estimates to select the best interpolation scheme for each climate variable. We also present the performance of the best interpolation for each climate variable at daily timescales and for river basins. The inverse distance weighting and angular distance weighting methods produced the best results. Performance of all methods was poorer prior to 1995 because of fewer stations and available data. The performance of the interpolation varies for different seasons for almost all variables. Forecasting capability was tested for precipitation only and performed adequately for the system state (wet or dry). Variations in the interpolation schemes across river basins are primarily attributed to differences in gauge or station network density. This freely available gridded meteorological data set significantly advances the availability of climate data in Brazil.},

Here, we explore the potential of markets and their interaction with policies to leverage investment for FLR in the tropics. We first review the challenges and opportunities of exploiting market forces for FLR, which can be essential for kick-starting the implementation of programs globally. We identify four key opportunities for regulating markets to promote FLR: economic mechanisms; technological, educational or infrastructural investment; legal and enforcement mechanisms; and market-led standards and certification schemes. Finally, we present five pitfalls that may arise when relying on markets to promote FLR. Governments will need to play a critical role in establishing appropriate policy frameworks and institutional arrangements to leverage investments when market signals are not strong enough to initiate changes in traditional land use or farming practices, or to regulate reforestation activities when market signals become so strong that they overwhelm all other land-use activities, leading to a transformed and homogenized landscape.},

	abstract = {The fulfilment of the benefits resulting from services provided by nature requires an integrated framework that combines appropriate ecosystem service governance with spatially explicit models of service provision. Here, we propose using a social-ecological network approach to develop a ‘landscape governance framework’ that identifies how different types of governance can act on supply, demand and flow of ecosystem services through changes in landscape structure and connections. Starting from undesirable situations where demand exceeds supply, we exemplify the application of this conceptual model considering hierarchical (e.g. creation of protected areas), market (e.g. payments for environmental services) and community-based (e.g. enhancing links between stakeholders) governance approaches. We show how interventions associated with each of these approaches act in distinct ways to regulate different components of the service provision chain in heterogeneous landscapes. Filling such knowledge gaps can help identify appropriate governance interventions depending on factors that limit provision: restricted supply, demand or flow. The application of the landscape governance framework entails challenges related to availability of data and limited understanding of key underlying mechanisms. However, it opens important new research questions at the interface between governance and ecosystem services, with great potential as a tool for landscape management that aims to achieve ecosystem service sustainability.

The ‘passive sampling’ hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat7,8, whereas the ‘ecosystem decay’ hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone9,10. Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments—when controlled for sampling effort—contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

	abstract = {Private conservation lands are essential for protecting biodiversity, but few national-level studies have assessed their coverage and the legal frameworks that support them. Here, we review the legal mechanisms enabling conservation on private lands in Brazil and evaluate these lands' potential to reinforce the national protected area system. We found that conserving native vegetation on private lands is the most important mechanism to protect biodiversity in five out of the six Brazilian biomes. Because Brazil has a law that mandates landowners to set aside conservation areas, remnants of native vegetation were protected rather than converted to other land uses in areas of old economic frontiers. These remnants can be the cornerstones of effective regional conservation systems. Still, upgrading these remnants to privately protected areas and integrating these privately protected areas into the national protected area system remains a challenge. We suggest that the Brazilian experience provides important lessons on how other countries can design innovative policies to recognize and expand private land conservation.},

A total of 11,771 articles were screened by abstract and title, 275 articles included for full review, with 56 articles (55 cases) selected. A majority of studies (78\%) found evidence of positive outcomes in the use of agroecological practices on food security and nutrition of households in low and middle-income countries. Agroecological practices included crop diversification, intercropping, agroforestry, integrating crop and livestock, and soil management measures. More complex agroecological systems, that included multiple components (e.g., crop diversification, mixed crop-livestock systems and farmer-to-farmer networks) were more likely to have positive food security and nutrition outcomes.},

	abstract = {Increased agricultural production through both intensification and extensification is a major driver of the current biodiversity crisis. As a response, two contrasting approaches have been advocated: ‘land sparing’, which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield, and ‘land sharing’, which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but decreases agricultural yields. While these approaches have been useful in drawing attention to the impact of meeting the growing global demand for agricultural products on biodiversity, they have been driven mainly by conservation ecologists, and have often overlooked important issues related to farming. As agricultural scientists with practical experience in developing, testing and scaling alternative forms of agriculture in some of the most biodiversity-rich areas of Latin America, Eastern and Southern Africa and South Asia, we are pointing in this paper at what we see as being two major limitations of the land sparing/sharing framework: (1) the reliance on yield-density relationships that focus on trade-offs and overlook synergies between agriculture and biodiversity, and (2) the overemphasis on crop yield, neglecting other metrics of agricultural performance which may be more important to local farmers, and more strongly associated with positive biodiversity outcomes. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate other agricultural scientists to contribute to the land sparing/sharing framework, in order to develop together with conservation ecologists viable solutions for both improved agricultural production and biodiversity conservation.},

Brazilian legislation requires that all farms in the country maintain and protect forest areas known as Legal Reserves. Since Legal Reserves have major implications for forest conservation and agricultural production, it is key that we understand landholders' perceptions towards Legal Reserves. We applied Q methodology to identify different perspectives of medium and large landholders on Legal Reserves and their relation to agricultural intensification in the municipality of Paragominas, eastern Amazon. We conducted 31 interviews in which landholders sorted 36 statements in a quasi-normal distribution array. Three groups of landholders were identified: 1) Land use planning enthusiasts (n = 16) were interested in zoning initiatives to explore alternative landscape designs and legislation that may deliver better conservation and production outcomes; 2) Agrochemical-based agriculture supporters (n = 7) held the most critical views against Legal Reserves and perceived their costs as higher than the potential environmental and life quality benefits; 3) Policy complacent-market responders (n = 4) showed no interest in Legal Reserves reforms and were the most market driven group.. While Paragominas has achieved notable successes in halting large-scale deforestation through a social “Green Municipality” pact, addressing persisting forest degradation and fragmentation in the region remains a key priority. Local governance initiatives that account for multi-stakeholder perceptions on forest conservation can foster dialogue and mutual understanding to effectively conserve and restore Legal Reserves. Insights on large landholders' perceptions on Legal Reserves can inform such governance processes to reconcile forest conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification in Paragominas.},

	abstract = {Although offsetting schemes may avoid biodiversity loss, the implementation of these schemes can be challenging, given the difficulty of balancing biodiversity benefits with the resulting increase in compensation costs. Here we have developed a novel offsetting methodological approach to balance environmental gains and land availability to support the decision-making process and negotiations among stakeholders. We applied this approach for the compensation of Legal Reserves, a percentage of native vegetation area that landowners have to set apart in their rural properties in Brazil to maintain native vegetation. If landowners do not reach the Legal Reserves requirements on their land according to the law, they may compensate it in other equivalent properties. To balance environmental gains and land availability, we have developed a dynamic tool that allows users to objectively analyze results from multiple offsetting scenarios. These scenarios can combine different levels of abiotic and biotic equivalence requirements, along with the possibility of trading up, i.e. compensating in priority natural vegetation areas and/or priority areas for restoration, even without high equivalence, with the resulting balance on land availability. The proposed approach seeks to find acceptable solutions, balancing stakeholder requirements for ecological equivalence, land availability, and possibilities of trading up. This procedure can enhance the local trade of Legal Reserves compensation, minimizing biodiversity losses, and also reducing costs. Our case study shows that it is possible to apply ecological equivalence in a balanced manner for Legal Reserve compensation. Owing to its flexibility, the proposed approach and tool can be easily adopted by other compensation schemes worldwide, supporting the negotiation and decision-making processes, to reduce biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian native vegetation supports essential ecosystem services and biodiversity for the global society, while land use competition may intensify around the increasing needs for food, fibre and bioenergy. The Brazilian Forest Act of 2012 amplified a market-based mechanism for offsetting native vegetation deficits in private farmlands. This mechanism enables a large-scale trading system allowing landholders to offset their own deficits of native vegetation by purchasing certificates associated with a surplus of native vegetation from other landholders. This mechanism is an alternative for the more expensive restoration of native vegetation on own land. The launching of the mechanism now depends on specific regulations at state level, which may include geographical restrictions for offsetting deficits. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects in nature protection and socio-economic development of different offsetting implementation alternatives. Our findings suggest that in a business-as-usual scenario the offsetting mechanism may have little or no additional effects on protection of native vegetation, because most of the offsetting is likely to take place where native vegetation is already protected by prevailing legislations. We concluded that it is possible to maximise environmental and socio-economic returns from the offsetting mechanism without undermining productive land. This would be possible if regulations ensure additionality in nature protection while enabling a self-sustaining mechanism for income generation for small-scale family farmers in the poorest region of Brazil, protecting biodiversity and counteracting major trade-offs between ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95\% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {\textgreater}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

Social-ecological contexts were represented by biophysical and legal factors (distance to towns and roads, elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness, rainfall, PLCA size, distance to state-owned national parks, and presence of legal protection) and, for a subset of commercially-operated PLCAs, management factors (adopted business model, and profitability). Biophysical and legal contextual factors had low explanatory power in the best model for the nationwide analysis (n = 5121 PLCAs). For a subset of PLCAs (n = 72) we found that effectiveness depended on the strategy they adopted to generate an income, as opposed to the amount of income itself. PLCAs that attracted high volumes of visitors to small properties to view charismatic “Big 5” wildlife were less effective in conserving natural land cover than larger, more exclusive “Big 5” PLCAs and those focused on hunting. Overall, site-specific management factors were better at explaining the effectiveness of PLCAs than biophysical factors. Our findings indicate that conservation practitioners and policy makers need to recognise the diverse goals, motivations and management models of PLCAs when considering how to support them in conserving biodiversity. Future studies could explore whether these trends hold for other proxies of biodiversity conservation, beyond land cover change.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates compliance with environmental laws in the municipality of Sorriso and the impact of changing legislation on vegetation. To verify the size of the properties, the areas designated as legal reserves (LRs), permanent protection areas (APPs), and springs were studied. Details of compliance with the New Forest Code (NFC) were drawn from the Rural Environmental Register (CAR) database. The database provided by PRODES/CERRADO was used to gather data to monitor deforested areas. SojaMaps data were used to verify the areas used for soybean cultivation followed by the Perpendicular Crop Enhancement Index. The data were plotted and superimposed on the deforestation data provided by PRODES/CERRADO. The areas were calculated using QGiS software version 2.18.22. The results showed that only 20.04\% of the original Cerrado vegetation cover remains in the municipality. The results also revealed environmental LR, APP, and spring deficits of 92,772.32, 1,656.28, and 322.86 ha, respectively. Measures such as the CAR in the New Forest Code are ineffective for inhibiting illegal deforestation, and new legislation authorized the loss of 75.22\% of the APP areas due for recovery. The proposed changes to eliminate LRs will allow the suppression of 91,000 ha of vegetation in Sorriso. Expanding the Amazon Soy Moratorium to the Cerrado could bring immediate benefits to the maintenance of the last continuous forested areas in this biome.},

Thus, the identification of the main drivers of this process in agricultural landscapes is critical to understand the drivers determining restoration success. A growing number of studies have explored the biophysical and, less often, the socioeconomic drivers of forest regeneration using remote sensing approaches, but have not directly considered the influence of farmers’ decisions in spatial prediction models of forest regeneration. We explored the influence of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers on forest regeneration in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil, where native forest cover increased by 7.7\%. We evaluated forest regeneration through the analysis of time series of multi-temporal satellite images and socioeconomic information obtained through a Social Survey with 47 landowners, using each farm as the study unit. Natural forest regeneration was mainly favored by lower land suitability for agriculture and higher proximity (lower distances) to forest remnants, as well by higher numbers of land-uses types in the farm and lower economic dependence of landowners from the farm income. Our results emphasize the importance of considering farmers’ decisions on predictive models of natural forest regeneration, which are critically needed to guide the implementation of large-scale forest restoration initiatives in agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {To achieve regional and international large-scale restoration goals with minimum costs, several restoration commitments rely on natural regeneration, a passive and inexpensive strategy. However, natural regeneration potential may vary within the landscape, mainly due to its historical context. In this work, we use spatially explicit restoration scenarios to explore how and where, within a given region, multiple restoration commitments could be combined to achieve cost-effectiveness outcomes. Our goal is to facilitate the elaboration of forest restoration plans at the regional level, taking into consideration the costs for active and passive restoration methods. The approach includes (1) a statistical analysis to estimate the natural regeneration potential for a given area based on alternative sets of biophysical, land cover, and/or socioeconomic factors and (2) the use of a land change allocation model to explore the cost-effectiveness of combining multiple restoration commitments in a given area through alternative scenarios. We test our approach in a strategic region in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, the Paraiba Valley in São Paulo State. Using the available data for 2011, calibrated for 2015, we build alternative scenarios for allocating natural regeneration until 2025. Our models indicate that the natural regeneration potential of the region is actually very low, and the cost-effectiveness outcomes are similar for all scenarios. We believe our approach can be used to support the regional-level decision-making about the implementation of multiple commitments aiming at the same target area. It can also be combined with other approaches for more refined analysis (e.g., optimization models).},

Though the maintenance of pollination services are known to be synergistic with biodiversity conservation and agricultural economic development, there are few decision support tools that explicitly show how to balance these competing objectives. We developed a novel, spatially explicit method that includes pollination supply, flow, demand, and benefits into an agricultural expansion context to improve land use decisions for agricultural outcomes that minimize environmental impacts. We provide the first study showing the trade-offs between yields and forest retention that uses all the components of pollination services across five planning scenarios (i.e. (a) baseline, (b) absence of pollinators, (c) pollinators present, (d) pollination and non-aggregated forest, (e) pollination and aggregated forest) using data on coffee from Costa Rica. The scenario that showed the highest trade-offs was when pollination services are considered unimportant, which led to a decrease on average yields (∼−23\% compared to baseline), whilst also decimating remaining forest (−100\% compared to baseline). Better forest retention was achieved in a scenario where pollination services were considered and more forest aggregation was required. In this case, total production incremented by ∼29\% while ∼74\% of forest patches were preserved. The flexibility of our framework allows adaptation to any crop that benefit from pollination services in different landscape contexts.},

	abstract = {Global food production needs to be increased by 60–110\% between 2005 and 2050 to meet growing food and feed demand. Intensification and/or expansion of agriculture are the two main options available to meet the growing crop demands. Land conversion to expand cultivated land increases GHG emissions and impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services. Closing yield gaps to attain potential yields may be a viable option to increase the global crop production. Traditional methods of agricultural intensification often have negative externalities. Therefore, there is a need to explore location-specific methods of sustainable agricultural intensification. We identified regions where the achievement of potential crop calorie production on currently cultivated land will meet the present and future food demand based on scenario analyses considering population growth and changes in dietary habits. By closing yield gaps in the current irrigated and rain-fed cultivated land, about 24\% and 80\% more crop calories can respectively be produced compared to 2000. Most countries will reach food self-sufficiency or improve their current food self-sufficiency levels if potential crop production levels are achieved. As a novel approach, we defined specific input and agricultural management strategies required to achieve the potential production by overcoming biophysical and socioeconomic constraints causing yield gaps. The management strategies include: fertilizers, pesticides, advanced soil management, land improvement, management strategies coping with weather induced yield variability, and improving market accessibility. Finally, we estimated the required fertilizers (N, P2O5, and K2O) to attain the potential yields. Globally, N-fertilizer application needs to increase by 45–73\%, P2O5-fertilizer by 22–46\%, and K2O-fertilizer by 2–3 times compared to the year 2010 to attain potential crop production. The sustainability of such agricultural intensification largely depends on the way management strategies for closing yield gaps are chosen and implemented.},

Engaging ranchers requires understanding their perceptions about how improved management and conservation practices fit into their overall production strategy. To assess ranchers’ motivations and limitations for adopting conservation-friendly practices, I surveyed 191 ranchers and extension agents participating in a silvopastoral project in Colombia. I found that ranchers are integrating multiple practices they perceive as complementary for achieving their goals: practices aimed at improving productivity are motivated by utilitarian values, while practices targeting environmental degradation and climate change are driven by stewardship and identity values. Input costs and labor shortages currently limit the expansion of conservation-friendly practices, but in-kind support and small cash payments could potentially alleviate these barriers. Silvopastoral ranchers can be instrumental partners in FLR provided that initiatives are designed with their perspectives in mind.},

They can reduce the current financial gap for biodiversity conservation in the country. Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately US\$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also very high, with estimates from US\$ 1 to US\$ 20 billion up to 2030. Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties, and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges for large-scale implementation of these instruments.},

	abstract = {Setting aside private land is an essential component of the biodiversity crisis response. In Brazil, landowners are required to have Legal Reserves (LR) (20\%–80\% of their property set aside for native vegetation) which, if degraded, need to be restored. Alternatively, landowners can compensate for an LR deficit by purchasing surplus credits. Each landowner can define the location and spatial arrangement of their LR, affecting the reserve's ability to maintain biodiversity and provide ecosystem services (ES). We used hierarchical models to determine drivers for the amount and location of those LR in 3622 farms. The likelihood of setting aside part of the farm as LR (avoiding off-farm compensation) increased with farm size and extent of native vegetation cover, particularly for riparian areas and steep slopes, where conserving vegetation is also mandated in what are called Areas of Permanent Protection (APP). Properties with APP were more likely to meet the full LR requirement within their areas if located in areas of higher transportation costs and lower agricultural suitability. Within properties, the location of LR was mostly in areas with low agricultural suitability, high transportation cost, and close to APP. Landowners' decisions intend to maximize property income and reduce restoration costs, resulting in a spatial pattern similar to public protected areas — usually located on marginal land for agriculture. These areas do not necessarily provide the greatest biodiversity and ES benefits, suggesting that government interventions may be needed to encourage landowners to set aside native vegetation in ways that maximize conservation and ES outcomes.},

	abstract = {To meet the ambitious objectives of biodiversity and climate conventions, the international community requires clarity on how these objectives can be operationalized spatially and how multiple targets can be pursued concurrently. To support goal setting and the implementation of international strategies and action plans, spatial guidance is needed to identify which land areas have the potential to generate the greatest synergies between conserving biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people. Here we present results from a joint optimization that minimizes the number of threatened species, maximizes carbon retention and water quality regulation, and ranks terrestrial conservation priorities globally. We found that selecting the top-ranked 30\% and 50\% of terrestrial land area would conserve respectively 60.7\% and 85.3\% of the estimated total carbon stock and 66\% and 89.8\% of all clean water, in addition to meeting conservation targets for 57.9\% and 79\% of all species considered. Our data and prioritization further suggest that adequately conserving all species considered (vertebrates and plants) would require giving conservation attention to {\textasciitilde}70\% of the terrestrial land surface. If priority was given to biodiversity only, managing 30\% of optimally located land area for conservation may be sufficient to meet conservation targets for 81.3\% of the terrestrial plant and vertebrate species considered. Our results provide a global assessment of where land could be optimally managed for conservation. We discuss how such a spatial prioritization framework can support the implementation of the biodiversity and climate conventions. Global spatial data for terrestrial vertebrate and vascular plant diversity, above- and below-ground biomass carbon, and potential clean freshwater volume are combined in a joint optimization study to identify potential synergies for conservation management.},

	abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970s, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods—or developing methods related to matching—do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

However, statisticians and econometricians have stressed that results rely on untestable assumptions, and therefore, guidelines for researchers on how to improve credibility have been developed. We follow one of these guidelines with a data set analysed by other authors to evaluate the impact of Fair Trade certification on the income of coffee producers. We provide thereby a best practice example of how to evaluate the credibility of PSM estimates. We find that a thorough assessment of the assumptions made renders the data we use not suitable for a credible PSM estimation of the effects of treatment.

	abstract = {Crop pollination is one of Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) that reconciles biodiversity conservation and agricultural production. NCP benefits vary across space, including among distinct political-administrative levels within nations. Moreover, initiatives to restore ecosystems may enhance NCP provision, such as crop pollination delivered by native pollinators. We mapped crop pollination demand (PD), diversity of pollinator-dependent crops, and vegetation deficit (VD) (vis-a-vis Brazilian legal requirements) across all 5570 municipalities in Brazil. Pollinator-dependent crops represented ∼55\% of the annual monetary value of agricultural production and ∼15\% of the annual crop production. Municipalities with greater crop PD (i.e., higher degree of pollinator dependence of crop production) also had greater VD, associated with large properties and monocultures. In contrast, municipalities with a greater diversity of pollinator-dependent crops and predominantly small properties presented a smaller VD. Our results support that ecological restoration prompted by legal requirements offers great potential to promote crop productivity in larger properties. Moreover, conservation of vegetation remnants could support food security in small properties. We provided the first steps to identify spatial patterns linking biodiversity conservation and pollination service. Using Brazilian legal requirements as an example, we show that land-use management policies may be successfully used to ensure agricultural sustainability and crop production.},

We find that croplands have expanded at a rate of over one million acres per year, and that 69.5\% of new cropland areas produced yields below the national average, with a mean yield deficit of 6.5\%. Observed conversion infringed upon high-quality habitat that, relative to unconverted land, had provided over three times higher milkweed stem densities in the Monarch butterfly Midwest summer breeding range and 37\% more nesting opportunities per acre for waterfowl in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Northern Great Plains. Our findings demonstrate a pervasive pattern of encroachment into areas that are increasingly marginal for production, but highly significant for wildlife, and suggest that such tradeoffs may be further amplified by future cropland expansion.},

Observational designs that use panel data are widely portrayed as superior to time-series or cross-sectional designs because they provide opportunities to control for observable and unobservable variables correlated with outcomes and exposure to a program. The most popular panel data evaluation designs use linear, fixed-effects estimators with additive individual and time effects. To assess the ability of observational designs to replicate results from experimental designs, scholars use design replications. No such replications have assessed popular, fixed-effects panel data models that exploit repeated observations before and after treatment assignment. We implement such a study using, as a benchmark, results from a randomized environmental program that included effective and ineffective treatments. The popular linear, fixed-effects estimator fails to generate impact estimates or statistical inferences similar to the experimental estimator. Applying common flexible model specifications or trimming procedures also fail to yield accurate estimates or inferences. However, following best practices for selecting a nonexperimental comparison group and combining matching methods with panel data estimators, we replicate the experimental benchmarks. We demonstrate how the combination of panel and matching methods mitigates common concerns about specifying the correct functional form, the nature of treatment effect heterogeneity, and the way in which time enters the model. Our results are consistent with recent claims that design trumps methods in estimating treatment effects and that combining designs is more likely to approximate a randomized controlled trial than applying a single design.},

However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy-relevant control–impact questions-such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control–impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal. Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non-experimental control–impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub-disciplines. Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control–impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias. Satellite-, survey- and citizen–science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science-informed policy.},

Certification of organic production is largely restricted to banning synthetic agrochemicals, resulting in limited benefits for biodiversity but high yield losses despite ongoing intensification and specialisation. In contrast, successful agricultural measures to enhance biodiversity include diversifying cropland and reducing field size, which can multiply biodiversity while sustaining high yields in both conventional and organic systems. Achieving a landscape-level mosaic of natural habitat patches and fine-grained cropland diversification in both conventional and organic agriculture is key for promoting large-scale biodiversity.

	abstract = {Animal pollinators are globally threatened by anthropogenic land use change and agricultural intensification. The yield of many food crops is therefore negatively impacted because they benefit from biotic pollination. This is especially the case in the tropics. For instance, fruit set of Coffea arabica has been shown to increase by 10–30\% in plantations with a high richness of bee species, possibly influenced by the availability of surrounding forest habitat. Here, we performed a global literature review to (1) assess how much animal pollination enhances coffee fruit set, and to (2) examine the importance of the amount of forest cover, distance to nearby forest and forest canopy density for bee species richness and coffee fruit set. Using a systematic literature review, we identified eleven case studies with a total of 182 samples where fruit set of C. arabica was assessed. We subsequently gathered forest data for all study sites from satellite imagery. We modelled the effects of open (all forest with a canopy density of ≥25\%), closed (≥50\%) and dense (≥75\%) forests on pollinator richness and fruit set of coffee. Overall, we found that animal pollination increases coffee fruit set by {\textasciitilde}18\% on average. In only one of the case studies, regression results indicate a positive effect of dense forest on coffee fruit set, which increased with higher forest cover and shorter distance to the forest. Against expectations, forest cover and distance to open forest were not related to bee species richness and fruit set. In summary, we provide strong empirical support for the notion that animal pollinators increase coffee fruit set. Forest proximity had little overall influence on bee richness and coffee fruit set, except when farms were surrounded by dense tropical forests, potentially because these may provide high-quality habitats for bees pollinating coffee. We, therefore, advocate that more research is done to understand the biodiversity value of dense forest for pollinators, notably assessing the mechanisms underlying the importance of forest for pollinators and their pollination services.},

	abstract = {The provision of ecosystem services is inherently spatial. Landscape structure affects service provision through multiple landscape-level processes, such as fragmentation, edge and connectivity effects. These processes can affect areas of ecosystem service supply and demand, and the flows linking those areas. Despite the emergence of sophisticated spatial ecosystem service assessments in the last two decades, we show through a literature review that landscape-level processes are still rarely considered in a comprehensive way. Even when they are considered, landscape effects are mostly limited to landscape composition, and configuration effects are underrepresented. Furthermore, most studies infer ecosystem service provision by only evaluating supply, ignoring demand and flows. Here we present a simple conceptual framework that illustrates how to incorporate landscape-level processes in the assessment of the different components of the service provision chain (supply, demand and flows). Using simulations, we evaluated how estimations of ecosystem service provision change when considering different landscape processes and discussed the implications of disregarding landscape effects. However, to fully implement the framework, a series of challenges linked to mapping and quantifying supply and demand, defining adequate scales of analysis, measuring flows, and parameterizing models for different types of services, still need to be overcome. To promote an adequate use and management of ecosystem services, it is essential to better incorporate landscape processes in ecosystem service assessments. This will lead to more quantitatively accurate and spatially precise estimates.},

	abstract = {Although deforestation remains widespread in the tropics, many places are now experiencing significant forest recovery (i.e., forest transition), offering an optimistic outlook for natural ecosystem recovery and carbon sequestration. Naturally regenerated forests, however, may not persist so a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of forest change in the tropics is critical to ensure the success of reforestation efforts and carbon sequestration targets. Here we use 35 years of detailed land cover data to investigate forest trajectories in 3,014 municipalities in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity and conservation hotspot. Although deforestation was evident in some regions, deforestation reversals, the typical forest transition trajectory, were the prevalent trend in the Atlantic Forest, accounting for 38\% of municipalities. However, simultaneous reforestation reversals in the region (13\% of municipalities) suggest that these short-term increases in native forest cover do not necessarily translate into persistent trends. In the absence of reversals in reforestation, forests in the region could have sequestered 1.75 Pg C, over three times the actual estimated carbon sequestration (0.52 Pg C). We also showed that failure to distinguish native and planted forests would have masked native forest cover loss in the region and overestimated reforestation by 3.2Mha and carbon sequestration from natural forest regeneration by 0.37 Pg C. Deforestation reversals were prevalent in urbanized municipalities with limited forest cover and high agricultural productivity, highlighting the importance of favorable socio-economic conditions in promoting reforestation. Successful forest restoration efforts will require development and enforcement of environmental policies that promote forest regeneration and ensure the permanence of regrowing forests. This is crucial not only for the fate and conservation of the Atlantic Forest, but also for other tropical nations to achieve their restoration and carbon sequestration commitments.},

	abstract = {Native vegetation in private lands plays an important role in providing ecosystem services and safeguarding biodiversity worldwide. Legal protection rules of this vegetation are thus crucial. In Brazil, since 1934, there has been a requirement for landowners to preserve a percentage of their land covered with native vegetation, the Legal Reserve. However, the 1934 legislation applies only to arboreal vegetation, while the protection of savannahs and grasslands begins after 1965 and 1989. The reference year for the application of Legal Reserves can thus have significant impacts on the amount of native vegetation legally protected. Here we tested the effects on Legal Reserve cover in São Paulo State, considering two different legal benchmarks as starting points: 1934 and 1965. Given that the 1934 law precedes the first aerial mapping in Brazil, we developed a methodology to estimate past native vegetation cover through a probabilistic approach. The forest deficit considering 1934 as the initial point is 3\% lower than the one starting with the 1965 benchmark. Comparing both scenarios, the 1934 led to a reduction of 1255 farms with Legal Reserve deficit from a total of 30,417. For both scenarios, Legal Reserve deficits were concentrated in the West, Northwest, and Mid-west regions of the state. The outcomes showed that the benchmark change does not significantly affect the total area of Legal Reserves protection, the number of farms potentially benefited by this mechanism, and the amount of native vegetation deficit. However, the use of the 1934 as an initial date for considering protection of Legal Reserve can delay the implementation of the law due to a time-consuming farm-by-farm analysis, once the probabilistic map has an intrinsic limitation for an automatic process. Thus, the environmental gains with the adoption of 1934 as the initial date do not overcome the limitations of using a probabilistic map, suggesting that effective law enforcement depends on reliable and more recent baselines, allowing semi-automated analyses. This scientific evidence can be adopted by the other Brazilian States that have not yet defined the initial legal benchmark, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of adopting the 1934 Forest Act.},

We find that, prior to the ACA expansions, mortality rates across expansion and non-expansion states trended similarly, but beginning in the first year of the policy, there were significant reductions in mortality in states that opted to expand relative to non- expanders. Individuals in expansion states experienced a 0.132 percentage point decline in annual mortality, a 9.4 percent reduction over the sample mean, as a result of the Medicaid expansions. The effect is driven by a reduction in disease-related deaths and grows over time.

Across 2253 municipalities, those with higher deforestation see a significant rise in deforestation during federal-and-state election years. Municipal election years raise deforestation for locations with lower deforestation, whereas all of these increases are accentuated when there is party alignment between different levels of government.

We characterize these connections on the basis of the channels through which such connections arise (i.e., knowing, perceiving, interacting with, and living within) and the components of human well-being they affect (e.g., physical, mental and spiritual health, inspiration, identity). We found enormous variation in the methods used, quantity of research, and generalizability of the literature. The effects of nature on mental and physical health have been rigorously demonstrated, whereas other effects (e.g., on learning) are theorized but seldom demonstrated. The balance of evidence indicates conclusively that knowing and experiencing nature makes us generally happier, healthier people. More fully characterizing our intangible connections with nature will help shape decisions that benefit people and the ecosystems on which we depend.},

Reviews of this topic have generally focused on a specific type of benefit, been limited to a single discipline, or covered the benefits delivered from a particular type of interaction. Here we construct novel typologies of the settings, interactions and potential benefits of people-nature experiences, and use these to organise an assessment of the benefits of interacting with nature. We discover that evidence for the benefits of interacting with nature is geographically biased towards high latitudes and Western societies, potentially contributing to a focus on certain types of settings and benefits. Social scientists have been the most active researchers in this field. Contributions from ecologists are few in number, perhaps hindering the identification of key ecological features of the natural environment that deliver human benefits. Although many types of benefits have been studied, benefits to physical health, cognitive performance and psychological well-being have received much more attention than the social or spiritual benefits of interacting with nature, despite the potential for important consequences arising from the latter. The evidence for most benefits is correlational, and although there are several experimental studies, little as yet is known about the mechanisms that are important for delivering these benefits. For example, we do not know which characteristics of natural settings (e.g., biodiversity, level of disturbance, proximity, accessibility) are most important for triggering a beneficial interaction, and how these characteristics vary in importance among cultures, geographic regions and socio-economic groups. These are key directions for future research if we are to design landscapes that promote high quality interactions between people and nature in a rapidly urbanising world.},

We address these gaps in knowledge by combining municipal-level panel data on diseases, public health services, climatic factors, demographics, conservation policies, and other drivers of land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon. To fully exploit this dataset, we estimate random-effects and quantile regression models of disease incidence. We find that malaria, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and diarrhea incidence are significantly and negatively correlated with the area under strict environmental protection. Results vary by disease for other types of protected areas (PAs), roads, and mining. The relationships between diseases and land-use change drivers also vary by quantile of the disease distribution. Conservation scenarios based on estimated regression results suggest that malaria, ARI, and diarrhea incidence would be reduced by expanding strict PAs, and malaria could be further reduced by restricting roads and mining. Although these relationships are complex, we conclude that interventions to preserve natural capital can deliver cobenefits by also increasing human (health) capital.},

              Fragmentation of natural environments as a result of human interference has been associated with a decrease in species richness and increase in abundance of a few species that have adapted to these environments. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest, which has been undergoing an intense process of fragmentation and deforestation caused by human-made changes to the environment, is an important hotspot for malaria transmission. The main vector of simian and human malaria in this biome is the mosquito
              Anopheles cruzii
              . Anthropogenic processes reduce the availability of natural resources at the tree canopies,
              An. cruzii
              primary habitat. As a consequence,
              An. cruzii
              moves to the border of the Atlantic Forest nearing urban areas seeking resources, increasing their contact with humans in the process. We hypothesized that different levels of anthropogenic changes to the environment can be an important factor in driving the genetic structure and diversity in
              An. cruzii
              populations. Five different hypotheses using a cross-sectional and a longitudinal design were tested to assess genetic structure in sympatric
              An. cruzii
              populations and microevolutionary processes driving these populations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to assess microgeographic genetic structure in
              An. cruzii
              populations in a low-endemicity area in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Our results show an overall weak genetic structure among the populations, indicating a high gene flow system. However, our results also pointed to the presence of significant genetic structure between sympatric
              An. cruzii
              populations collected at ground and tree-canopy habitats in the urban environment and higher genetic variation in the ground-level population. This indicates that anthropogenic modifications leading to habitat fragmentation and a higher genetic diversity and structure in ground-level populations could be driving the behavior of
              An. cruzii,
              ultimately increasing its contact with humans. Understanding how anthropogenic changes in natural areas affect
              An. cruzii
              is essential for the development of more effective mosquito control strategies and, on a broader scale, for malaria-elimination efforts in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

              breeding hotspots in urban areas is crucial for the design of effective vector control strategies. Remote sensing techniques offer valuable tools for mapping habitat suitability. In this study, we evaluated the association between urban landscape, thermal features, and mosquito infestations. Entomological surveys were conducted between 2016 and 2019 in Vila Toninho, a neighborhood of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, in which the numbers of adult female
              Ae. aegypti
              were recorded monthly and grouped by season for three years. We used data from 2016 to 2018 to build the model and data from summer of 2019 to validate it. WorldView-3 satellite images were used to extract land cover classes, and land surface temperature data were obtained using the Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). A multilevel negative binomial model was fitted to the data, which showed that the winter season has the greatest influence on decreases in mosquito abundance. Green areas and pavements were negatively associated, and a higher cover of asbestos roofs and exposed soil was positively associated with the presence of adult females. These features are related to socio-economic factors but also provide favorable breeding conditions for mosquitos. The application of remote sensing technologies has significant potential for optimizing vector control strategies, future mosquito suppression, and outbreak prediction.},

	abstract = {O presente artigo faz parte de uma pesquisa de mestrado, em desenvolvimento, do Departamento de Geografia da Universidade Estadual de Campinas, e tem como objetivo explorar uma iniciativa, em específico, de ecoturismo em ambientes de cerrado. Este bioma nacional, segundo em área territorial, resguarda importantes organismos de flora e fauna do país, muitos de caráter endêmico. Apesar de sua importância, encontra-se esquecido no imaginário da população e também em iniciativas de conservação, caracterizando-se como um hotspot, sofrendo impactos negativos derivados do avanço agropecuário. Esta savana, considerada a mais biodiversa do mundo, necessita de iniciativas de preservação que sensibilizem o ser humano a respeito de sua importância e situação de perigo atual. Nesse contexto, o ecoturismo emerge como uma possibilidade de reaproximação do homem com a natureza através da experiência e subjetividade, possibilitando situações de aprendizado informal e lúdico do ambiente. A busca pela natureza hoje, enquanto fenômeno social contemporâneo deve ultrapassar a dicotomia entre cultura e natureza apontando novas possibilidades de ação e conservação. É um consenso nos debates ambientais a importância da mudança de percepção que contemple não apenas o olhar racional do espaço, mas também a dimensão emotiva do ser humano. Desta forma, este estudo enfoca em um caso, em específico, de ecoturismo em áreas de cerrado, que é o da RPPN “Santuário do Caraça”, localizada no estado de Minas Gerais. Esta unidade possibilita a análise de situações interessantes em relação a esta atividade sendo elas a iniciativa de conservação em uma área particular, de posse de uma organização religiosa; o ecoturismo como alternativa para a preservação do ambiente e de um patrimônio histórico presente além da existência de um ritual que ocorre entre os padres da reserva e uma espécie endêmica do bioma, o lobo guará. Os resultados apresentados constituem em uma revisão bibliográfica sobre o tema e a relação desta com discursos dos visitantes, fruto da primeira fase da pesquisa. Estes discursos, de caráter qualitativo, foram coletados através de entrevistas semiestruturadas no período de julho de 2011, mês de alta recepção de turistas na unidade. Através destes foi possível observar a existência de um imaginário de valorização de grandes florestas em detrimento de paisagens inerentes ao cerrado. Porém, que o contato com este ambiente, através de dimensões mais emotivas do ser humano, provoca uma sensibilização e reflexão acerca dos impactos negativos gerados à natureza pela sociedade contemporânea, além de evidenciar um desejo de cuidado pelo ambiente após a experiência de contato com o local. O Ritual do Lobo Guará incita a curiosidade e o olhar mais subjetivo em relação ao local visitado. Entretanto, estas são as primeiras análises realizadas na unidade, o que evidencia o seu caráter peculiar no universo das iniciativas de ecoturismo neste bioma, revelando a importância do desenvolvimento da pesquisa na mesma.},

	abstract = {Introdução: O município de Brumadinho-MG vivenciou um desastre socioambiental após o rompimento de uma barragem da mineradora Vale em janeiro de 2019. Além dos mais de 240 mortos, esse evento culminou em modificações territoriais, ambientais, culturais e econômicas que seguem pondo em risco a população residente na região. Objetivo: Realizar uma análise epidemiológica quanto às notificações de Dengue e Chikungunya na população do município de Brumadinho-MG no período de 2018-2019. Metodologia O estudo de caráter transversal e retrospectivo teve como fonte de dados o Boletim epidemiológico “Um ano do desastre da Vale”, organizado e lançado pelo Ministério da Saúde do Brasil. Além disso, foram selecionados artigos publicados entre 2015-2020, disponíveis nas bases de dados Medline e Scopus. Resultados: Em 2018 foram registrados 25 casos prováveis de dengue, enquanto que, em 2019, ocorreram 1.032 casos prováveis. Isso representa uma elevação de 4.028\% em relação ao mesmo período do ano anterior, tendo uma incidência acumulada aumentada de 62,3 (x100mil habitantes) em 2018 para 2573,4 (x100mil habitantes) em 2019. Quanto à chikungunya, que não apresentou nenhum caso provável registrado no ano de 2018, foi observado o registro de 5 casos prováveis em 2019, tendo um aumento de incidência acumulada de 0,0 para 12,5 (x100mil habitantes). Conclusão: Mostrou-se evidente a necessidade de planejamentos governamentais que visem a proteção desta população quanto aos agravos em latência, assim como intensificar a proteção ambiental no país, a fim de evitar que tragédias como a ocorrida em Brumadinho sejam vivenciadas em outras localidades.},

Many natural enemies are inﬂuenced by non-crop habitat surrounding agricultural ﬁelds, and understanding if, and at what scales, land use patterns inﬂuence natural enemies is essential to predicting how landscape alters biological control services. Here we focus on biological control of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matumura, a specialist crop pest recently introduced to the north-central United States. We measured the amount of biological control service supplied to soybean in 26 replicate ﬁelds across Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota across two years (2005–2006). We measured the impact of natural enemies by experimentally excluding or allowing access to soybean aphid infested plants and comparing aphid population growth over 14 days. We also monitored aphid and natural enemy populations at large in each ﬁeld. Predators, principally coccinellid beetles, dominated the natural enemy community of soybean in both years. In the absence of aphid predators, A. glycines increased signiﬁcantly, with 5.3-fold higher aphid populations on plants in exclusion cages vs. the open ﬁeld after 14 days. We calculated a biological control services index (BSI) based on relative suppression of aphid populations and related it to landscape diversity and composition at multiple spatial scales surrounding each site. We found that BSI values increased with landscape diversity, measured as Simpson’s D. Landscapes dominated by corn and soybean ﬁelds provided less biocontrol service to soybean compared with landscapes with an abundance of crop and non-crop habitats. The abundance of Coccinellidae was related to landscape composition, with beetles being more abundant in landscapes with an abundance of forest and grassland compared with landscapes dominated by agricultural crops. Landscape diversity and composition at a scale of 1.5 km surrounding the focal ﬁeld explained the greatest proportion of the variation in BSI and Coccinellidae abundance. This study indicates that natural enemies provide a regionally important ecosystem service by suppressing a key soybean pest, reducing the need for insecticide applications. Furthermore, it suggests that management to maintain or enhance landscape diversity has the potential to stabilize or increase biocontrol services.},

	abstract = {While we were completing a year-long survey of soil invertebrates in eight citrus orchards in South Australia, there was an outbreak of Kelly’s citrus thrips (Pezothrips kellyanus). Four growers in our survey reported their orchards were free of thrips, while the others reported suffering serious economic damage. A retrospective analysis, using data from the invertebrate survey, showed that orchards without thrips damage all had dense ground cover (perennial grasses, diverse forbs and with a deep litter layer), whereas orchards with thrips damage all had patchy ground cover (bare mineral soil with scattered annual weeds or a sparse monoculture of lucerne or oats and no litter layer). Orchards with dense ground cover and no thrips damage had far denser populations of predatory mesostigmatid mites (mean 6471±692m−2 1 SE) compared with orchards with patchy ground cover and thrips damage (1097±126m−2). Most Mesostigmata (total 17 spp.) were generalist predators, capable of feeding on thrips larvae when they move from the fruit to the soil to pupate. We suggest the absence of thrips damage is causally related to the presence of a diverse, abundant fauna of natural enemies, enhanced by good quality ground cover habitat and that growers with no thrips damage are benefitting from the ecosystem service of natural pest control. Using three scenarios of increasing severity of thrips damage (10\%, 20\% and 40\%), we estimated the mean value of natural pest control of thrips as an ecosystem service was A\$ 2640, A\$ 4610 and A\$ 8540 per hectare for those orchards that benefited from the service, whereas those orchards that received no such benefit potentially lost A\$ 1970, A\$ 3260 and A\$ 5850 respectively. Our findings led to the planting of improved ground cover as habitat for predators by three growers, and the development of a commercial predator biocontrol agent for thrips by a fourth, based on mites harvested from his orchard. Growers who had effective natural pest control of thrips are more likely to have greater economic resilience in relation to price volatility shocks than those growers who do not benefit from this ecosystem service.},

	abstract = {Enhancing biodiversity-based ecosystem services can generate win–win opportunities for conservation and agricultural production. Pollination and pest control are two essential agricultural services provided by mobile organisms, many depending on native vegetation networks beyond the farm scale. Many studies have evaluated the effects of landscape changes on such services at small scales. However, several landscape management policies (e.g. selection of conservation sites) and associated funding allocation occur at much larger spatial scales (e.g. state or regional level). Therefore, it is essential to understand whether the links between landscape, ecosystem services and crop yields are robust across broad and heterogeneous regional conditions. Here, we used data from 610 Brazilian municipalities within the Atlantic Forest region ( 50 Mha) and show that forest is a crucial factor affecting coffee yields, regardless of regional variations in soil, climate and management practices. We found forest cover surrounding coffee fields was better at predicting coffee yields than forest cover at the municipality level. Moreover, the positive effect of forest cover on coffee yields was stronger for Coffea canephora, the species with higher pollinator dependence, than for Coffea arabica. Overall, coffee yields were highest when they were near to forest fragments, mostly in landscapes with intermediate to high forest cover ({\textgreater}20\%), above the biodiversity extinction threshold. Coffee cover was the most relevant management practice associated with coffee yield prediction. An increase in crop area was associated with a higher yield, but mostly in high forest covers municipalities. Other localized management practices like irrigation, pesticide use, organic manure and honeybee density had little importance in predicting coffee yields than landscape structure parameters. Neither the climatic or topographic variables were as relevant as forest cover at predicting coffee yields. Synthesis and application. Our work provides evidence that landscape relationships with ecosystem service provision are consistent across regions with different agricultural practices and environmental conditions. These results provide a way in which landscape management can articulate small landscape management with regional conservation goals. Policies directed towards increasing landscape interspersion of coffee fields with forest remnants favour spillover process, and can thus benefit the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services, increasing agricultural productivity. Such interventions can generate win–win situations favouring biodiversity conservation and increased crop yields across large regions.},

The use of scenarios has an enormous potential to reduce ecosystem restoration costs and to optimize benefits, but this potential remains poorly explored. Here, we recommend and illustrate six best practices to guide the use of scenarios for planning native ecosystem restoration. We argue, first, for a participatory process to consider aspirations of multiple stakeholders along the whole scenario building process, from planning to implementation and review phases. Second, targeted restoration outcomes should be defined by key-actors (those who have direct interests in restoration) and directly involved stakeholders, within a clear socio-environmental context and under a well-defined problem statement, considering a broad range of nature and human benefits that can be derived from ecosystem restoration. Third, methodological choices, such as scenario types, spatial and temporal scales, drivers, restoration-related variables, and indicators, should be defined according to the multiple desired outcomes. Fourth, we encourage the consideration of the interactions among variables, within a spatially explicit, and temporally dynamic multi-criteria approach. Fifth, analysis and dissemination of scenario results should highlight the trade-offs and synergies among different restoration outcomes, identifying the scenarios that maximize benefits and minimize costs and resistance (i.e. the cost-effective and most feasible scenario) for multiple targets. Finally, promoting capacity building, through a wider consultation process including interaction with a broader group of stakeholders, is critical for the successful implementation and review of restoration interventions. Scenarios that support ecosystem restoration should follow an adaptive and iterative process, aiming to continuously improve restoration interventions and outcomes.},

	abstract = {The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60\% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35\% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5\% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

Proper pollination can increase the production and quality of fruit, nut, oil, and fiber crops. We reviewed crop dependence on pollinators and estimated the economic value of pollination per year for each crop in Brazil. We analyzed 141 crops and found that 85 depend on pollinators. Almost one-third of these crops have an essential or great dependence on pollinators. The economic contribution of pollinators totals ∼30\% (∼US\$12 billion) of the total annual agricultural income of the dependent crops (totalizing almost US\$45 billion). However, half of these figures includes soybean crop (US\$5.7 billion of pollinators’ contribution and US\$22 billion of annual income). Soybean was considered as having a modest dependence on pollinators, but this remains controversial because pollinator dependence might vary among different varieties cultivated in Brazil. Moreover, we have no information about pollinator dependence regarding some important crops, showing the urgent need for basic research into reproductive biology and pollination ecology.},

	abstract = {Society responds to changes in climate and land use via mitigation measures, including rainwater retention and storage in rewetted and newly constructed wetlands. Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50m and 50km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25m and 6km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90\% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved. Additional quantitative research is needed to better document the non-oriented dispersal patterns of the mosquitoes that populate rewetted and newly constructed wetlands, and the effects of vegetation types in barrier zones on mosquito densities.},

	abstract = {Over the last several decades, voluntary certification programs have become a key approach to promote sustainable supply chains for agricultural commodities. These programs provide premiums and other benefits to producers for adhering to environmental and labor practices established by the certifying entities. Following the principles of Cochrane Reviews used in health sciences, we assess evidence to evaluate whether voluntary certification of tropical agricultural commodities (bananas, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, and tea) has achieved environmental benefits and improved economic and social outcomes for small-scale producers at the level of the farm household. We reviewed over 2600 papers in the peer-review literature and identified 24 cases of unique combinations of study area, certification program, and commodity in 16 papers that rigorously analyzed differences between treatment (certified households) and control groups (uncertified households) for a wide range of response variables. Based on analysis of 347 response variables reported in these papers, we conclude that certification is associated on average with positive outcomes for 34\% of response variables, no significant difference for 58\% of variables, and negative outcomes for 8\% of variables. No significant differences were observed for different categories of responses (environmental, economic and social) or for different commodities (banana, coffee and tea), except negative outcomes were significantly less for environmental than other outcome categories (p = 0.01). Most cases (20 out of 24) investigated coffee certification and response variables were inconsistent across cases, indicating the paucity of studies to conduct a conclusive meta-analysis. The somewhat positive results indicate that voluntary certification programs can sometimes play a role in meeting sustainable development goals and do not support the view that such programs are merely greenwashing. However, results also indicate that certification is not a panacea to improve social outcomes or overall incomes of smallholder farmers. Rigorous analysis, standardized criteria, and independent evaluation are needed to assess effectiveness of certification programs in the future.},

In principle, it can improve commodity producers’ environmental performance, even in countries where state regulation is weak. However, evidence needed to evaluate this hypothesis is virtually nonexistent. To help fill this gap, we use detailed farm-level data to analyze the environmental impacts of organic coffee certification in central Costa Rica. We use propensity score matching to control for self-selection bias. We find that organic certification improves coffee growers’ environmental performance. It significantly reduces chemical input use and increases adoption of some environmentally friendly management practices.},

Sustainability standards—rules that supply chain actors may follow to demonstrate their commitment to social equity and/or environmental protection—aim to mitigate such problems. We provide a narrative review of the effects of many distinct sustainability standards on different supply chain actors spanning multiple crops. Furthermore, we discuss five emerging questions—causality, exclusion, compliance and monitoring, excess supply and emerging country markets—and identify directions for future research. We find that, while sustainability standards can help improve the sustainability of production processes in certain situations, they are insufficient to ensure food system sustainability at scale, nor do they advance equity objectives in agrifood supply chains.},

	abstract = {Green labeling of products that have been produced sustainably is an emerging tool of the environmental movement. A prominent example is the Forest Stewardship Council, which certifies timber that is harvested to manage and maintain forests defined as having High Conservation Value (HCV). The criteria for HCV are now being applied to four rapidly expanding crops in the tropics: oil palm, soy, sugarcane, and cacao. However, these criteria do not provide adequate protection for biodiversity when applied to agriculture. The only criterion that provides blanket protection to forests is one that protects large expanses of habitat (≥20,000–500,000 ha, depending on the country). Absent of other HCVs, the collective clearing of forest patches below these thresholds could result in extensive deforestation that would be sanctioned with a green label. Yet such forest patches retain much biodiversity and provide connectivity within the agricultural matrix. An examination of forest fragments in biodiverse countries across the tropics shows that future agricultural demand can be met by clearing only forest patches below a 1,000 ha threshold. We recommend the development of a new HCV criterion that recognizes the conservation value of habitat patches within the agricultural matrix and that protects patches above 1,000 ha.},

In particular, there has been a rise of voluntary sustainability standards in an attempt to manage social and environmental impacts of global supply chains. We analyze the large spectrum of interactions between private, public, and civil society actors around voluntary sustainability standards, primarily for tropical agriculture and forestry. This review uncovers a policy ecosystem dominated by a proliferation of standards that complement, substitute, or compete against each other, with coordination mechanisms beginning to arise. Contrary to widely held views, interactions between governments, NGOs, and private companies surrounding the adoption of sustainable practices are not generally antagonistic, and public and private environmental governance regimes rarely operate independently. The influence of these interactions on the effectiveness of sustainability standards needs more attention. Better understanding how private regulations interact with the policy ecosystem will help design more effective interventions.},

A green product is an impure public good consisting of a private good (e.g., rain forest honey) bundled with a jointly produced public good (e.g., biodiversity protection). In the context of ecosystem protection, popular green commodities include eco-tourism excursions, coffee grown under forest canopies (‘shade-grown’), tagua nuts for buttons and ornaments, rainforest nuts and oils for cosmetic products, and rain forest honey. We examine the dynamic efficiency of eco-friendly price premiums in achieving ecosystem protection and rural welfare goals by contrasting the use of price premiums to the use of payments that are tied directly to ecosystem protection. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that direct payments are likely to be more efficient as a conservation policy instrument. Depending on the available funds, the direct payments may be better or worse than green price premiums in achieving rural welfare objectives. If direct payments are not feasible for social or political reasons, we demonstrate analytically and empirically that the price premium approach is likely to be more effective at achieving conservation and development objectives than the currently more popular policy of subsidizing capital acquisition in eco-friendly commercial activities.

	abstract = {Initiatives certifying that producers of goods and services adhere to defined environmental and social-welfare production standards are increasingly popular. According to proponents, these initiatives create financial incentives for producers to improve their environmental, social, and economic performance. We reviewed the evidence on whether these initiatives have such benefits. We identified peer-reviewed, ex post, producer-level studies in economic sectors in which certification is particularly prevalent (bananas, coffee, fish products, forest products, and tourism operations), classified these studies on the basis of whether their design and methods likely generated credible results, summarized findings from the studies with credible results, and considered how these findings might guide future research. We found 46 relevant studies, most of which focused on coffee and forest products and examined fair-trade and Forest Stewardship Council certification. The methods used in 11 studies likely generated credible results. Of these 11 studies, nine examined the economic effects and two the environmental effects of certification. The results of four of the 11 studies, all of which examined economic effects, showed that certification has producer-level benefits. Hence, the evidence to support the hypothesis that certification benefits the environment or producers is limited. More evidence could be generated by incorporating rigorous, independent evaluation into the design and implementation of projects promoting certification. Las iniciativas de certificación de productores de bienes y servidos que se apegan a estàndares ambientales y de producción de bienestar social son cada vez más populares. De acuerdo con los proponentes, estas iniciativas crean incentivos financieros para que los productores mejoren su desempefío ambiental, social y económico. Revisamos la evidencia para ver si esas iniciativas tienen tales benefícios. Identificamos estudios ex post y a nivel de productores sometidos a revisión cientifica external, en sectores económicos en los que la certificación es particularmente prevalente (plátano, café, productos pesqueros, productos forestales y operaciones turísticas), los clasificamos considerando si su diseño y métodos generaron resultados creíbles, sintetizamos los hallazgos de los estúdios con resultados creíbles y consideramos como estos hallazgos pueden dirigir investigaciones en el futuro. Encontramos 46 estúdios relevantes, muchos de ellos enfocados en café y productos comerciales y con certificación de comercio justo y Forest Stewardship Council. Los métodos utilizados en 11 estudios generaron resultados creíbles. De estos 11 estudios, nueve examinaron los efectos económicos y dos los efectos ambientales de la certificación. Los resultados de cuatro de los 11 estudios, todos examinando efectos económicos, mostraron que la certificación tiene beneficios a nivel de productores. Por lo tanto, la evidencia para apoyar la hipótesis de que la certificación beneficia al ambiente o a los productores es limitada.

Sustainable certification of coffee has been promoted as a means to provide incentives to maintain these systems, but as yet there is little evidence if this is effective. We analyzed tree diversity on smallholder organic and conventional farms in buffer zones of three conservation areas in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (the later included some large-scale conventional and Rainforest Alliance certified farms). Organic farms had greater farm level tree species richness and Shannon diversity compared to conventional farms; estimated native tree species richness across the landscape was probably greater on organic farms than conventional in Nicaragua (48 vs. 28 species respectively) and possibly in Guatemala (23 vs. 15 species respectively). Organic farms had higher shade levels and more tree strata than conventional farms. In Guatemala and Nicaragua tree species composition was not closely related to whether farms were organic or conventional, although within composition clusters, organic farms tended to have greater diversity. In contrast, organic and conventional farms in Costa Rica mostly belonged to different tree species clusters. In Nicaragua most large-scale farms, and all Rainforest certified farms, formed a distinct species composition cluster with presence of old-growth forest species and within which Rainforest farms had greater diversity. Tree species composition of the shade seems to be mainly due to management history; but certification effectively differentiates those farms with greater tree diversity. Longer-term monitoring is required to determine whether certification can be an incentive to conserve or expand biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems within the buffer zones around conservation areas.},

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) participated in an international project to acquire radar data which were used to create the first near-global set of land elevations. The radars used during the SRTM mission were actually developed and flown on two Endeavour missions in 1994. The C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar and the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) hardware were used on board the space shuttle in April and October 1994 to gather data about Earth's environment. The technology was modified for the SRTM mission to collect interferometric radar, which compared two radar images or signals taken at slightly different angles. This mission used single-pass interferometry, which acquired two signals at the same time by using two different radar antennas. An antenna located on board the space shuttle collected one data set and the other data set was collected by an antenna located at the end of a 60-meter mast that extended from the shuttle. Differences between the two signals allowed for the calculation of surface elevation. Endeavour orbited Earth 16 times each day during the 11-day mission, completing 176 orbits. SRTM successfully collected radar data over 80\% of the Earth's land surface between 60 degrees north and 56 degrees south latitude with data points posted every 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters).},

Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is
              possible
              to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

	abstract = {In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data. In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width). There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes). When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect. It also eliminated at least 98\% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates. Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct. When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.},

	abstract = {Multi-stakeholder roundtables offering certification programs are promising voluntary governance mechanisms to address sustainability issues associated with international agricultural supply chains. Yet, little is known about whether roundtable certifications confer additionality, the benefits of certification beyond what would be expected from policies and practices currently in place. Here, we examine the potential additionality of the Round table on Responsible Soybeans (RTRS) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in mitigating conversion of native vegetation to cropland. We develop a metric of additionality based on business as usual land cover change dynamics and roundtable standard stringency relative to existing policies. We apply this metric to all countries with RTRS (n = 8) and RSPO (n = 12) certified production in 2013–2014, as well as countries that have no certified production but are among the top ten global producers in terms of soy (n = 2) and oil palm (n = 2). We find RSPO and RTRS both have substantially higher levels of stringency than existing national policies except in Brazil and Uruguay. In regions where these certification standards are adopted, the mean estimated rate of tree cover conversion to the target crop is similar for both standards. RTRS has higher mean relative stringency than the RSPO, yet RSPO countries have slightly higher enforcement levels. Therefore, mean potential additionality of RTRS and RSPO is similar across regions. Notably, countries with the highest levels of additionality have some adoption. However, with extremely low adoption rates (0.41\% of 2014 global harvested area), RTRS likely has lower impact than RSPO (14\%). Like most certification programs, neither roundtable is effectively targeting smallholder producers. To improve natural ecosystem protection, roundtables could target adoption to regions with low levels of environmental governance and high rates of forest-to-cropland conversion.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

In the mid 1970ies, this region was recognized as unfertile with little possibility of agricultural use. From there on, a large part of this biome was occupied by extensive agricultural production, due to the advances in technology. The coffee crop is very important for the Brazilian agribusiness, and in recent years, part of its cultivation has been shifted from the traditional growing areas (e.g. São Paulo and southern of Minas Gerais) to some savannah areas (e.g. northwestern of Minas Gerais and western of Bahia). The Brazilian savannah has quite different edaphoclimatic conditions than the traditional coffee regions, and therefore crop management should be re-evaluated, including those concerning the nitrogen. This paper aims to review some studies already carried out on nitrogen fertilization in savannah coffee plantations.},

	abstract = {Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species’ biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world’s birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608–851 bird (6–9\%), 670–933 amphibian (11–15\%), and 47–73 coral species (6–9\%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower IPCC SRES emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and area-specific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.},

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.},

We find that restoring 15\% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60\% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30\% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning.

	abstract = {A B S T R A C T Landscape transformation due to agriculture affects more than 40\% of the planet's land area and is the most important driver of losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) worldwide. Ecological restoration may significantly reduce these losses, but its effectiveness has not been systematically assessed in agroecosystems at the global level. We quantitatively meta-analyzed the results of 54 studies of how restoration actions reflecting the two contrasting strategies of land sparing and land sharing affect levels of biodiversity and ES in a wide variety of agroecosystems in 20 countries. Restoration increased overall biodiversity of all organism types by an average of 68\%. It also increased the supply of many ES, in particular the levels of supporting ES by an average of 42\% and levels of regulating ES by an average of 120\% relative to levels in the pre-restoration agroecosystem. In fact, restored agroecosystems showed levels of biodiversity and supporting and regulating ES similar to those of reference ecosystems. Recovery levels did not correlate with the time since the last restoration action. Comparison of land sparing and land sharing as restoration strategies showed that while both were associated with similar biodiversity recovery, land sparing led to higher median ES response ratios. Passive and active restoration actions did not differ significantly in the levels of biodiversity or ES recovery. Biodiversity recovery positively correlated with ES recovery. We conclude that ecological restoration of agroecosystems is generally effective and can be recommended as a way to enhance biodiversity and supply of supporting and regulating ES in agricultural landscapes. Whether a land sharing or land sparing strategy is preferable remains an open question, and might be case dependent. Moreover, it is unclear whether crop production on restored land can meet future food production needs. ã},

	abstract = {* 1Experimental manipulations have shown positive impacts of increased species richness on ecosystem productivity, but there remain some questions about this relationship. First, most studies last {\textless} 4 years, which raises issues about whether diversity–productivity relationships are maintained in mature communities. Secondly, the conservation relevance of many studies is debatable. We addressed both issues using long-term experimental studies of the agriculturally relevant hay yield of recreated species-rich grasslands.
* 2Grasslands were recreated within replicated experiments in ex-arable fields at two sites in southern England by using either species-poor or species-rich seed mixtures. The species-poor mixture comprised seven grasses as recommended for grassland creation in English agri-environment schemes. The species-rich mixture comprised 11 grasses and 28 forbs and was designed to recreate a typical southern English hay meadow.
* 3After 8 years the plots sown with species-rich mixtures resembled target diverse community types. The plots sown with species-poor mixtures had been colonized by a number of forbs but had lower numbers of grasses, legumes and other forbs than the species-rich plots. Increased hay yield of the species-rich plots in the first years of the experiments have been described in an earlier paper, and these differences were maintained after 8 years.
* 4In the eighth year the species-rich plots had an average 43\% higher hay yield than the species-poor plots. Regression analysis showed that the variation in hay yield was related to differences in the number of non-leguminous forbs and showed no relation to grass or legume numbers. This suggests increased hay yield is an effect of the greater range of life forms exhibited by forbs rather than a simple fertilizing effect of legumes.
* 5The nitrogen content and phosphorus content of the hay showed complex treatment effects over time. However, the nutritional value of the hay was above the minimum requirements for livestock.
* 6Synthesis and applications. The aims of conservationists and farmers can often be in conflict. This study has shown that the recreation of diverse grasslands of conservation value can have a positive impact on hay yield, which benefits the farm business, and this is repeated across differing sites. Because the effect is maintained over time, farm income will be increased in the long term.},

The Society for Ecological Restoration International has produced generic guidelines for conceiving, organizing, conducting and assessing ecological restoration projects. Additionally, there are now good conceptual frameworks, guidelines and practical methods for developing ecological restoration programmes that are based on sound ecological principles and supported by empirical evidence and modelling approaches. Restoration methods must also be technically achievable and socially acceptable and spread over a range of locations. It is important to reconcile differences between methods that favour conservation and those that favour economic returns, to ensure that conservation efforts are beneficial for both landowners and biodiversity. One option for this type of mutual benefit is the use of agri-environmental schemes to provide financial incentives to landholders in exchange for providing conservation services and other benefits. However, further work is required to define and measure the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The broader potential for ecological restoration to improve the sustainability of agricultural production while conserving biodiversity in farmscapes and reducing external costs is high, but there is still much to learn, particularly for the most efficient use of agri-environmental schemes to change land use practice.},

The lack of rigorous analyses about the major components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil’s National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys (60–90\%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of magnitude cheaper but were reported in {\textless}15\% of projects. The vast majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during the implementation phase, and nearly 80\% of projects ended maintenance within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US\$0.7-1.2 billion per year until 2030 to implement Brazil’s restoration plan depending on the area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up restoration at a global scale.},

After screening over 200 studies, we examined the costs (94 studies) and benefits (225 studies) of ecosystem restoration projects that had sufficient reliable data in 9 different biomes ranging from coral reefs to tropical forests. Costs included capital investment and maintenance of the restoration project, and benefits were based on the monetary value of the total bundle of ecosystem services provided by the restored ecosystem. Assuming restoration is always imperfect and benefits attain only 75\% of the maximum value of the reference systems over 20 years, we calculated the net present value at the social discount rates of 2\% and 8\%. We also conducted 2 threshold cum sensitivity analyses. Benefit-cost ratios ranged from about 0.05:1 (coral reefs and coastal systems, worst-case scenario) to as much as 35:1 (grasslands, best-case scenario). Our results provide only partial estimates of benefits at one point in time and reflect the lower limit of the welfare benefits of ecosystem restoration because both scarcity of and demand for ecosystem services is increasing and new benefits of natural ecosystems and biological diversity are being discovered. Nonetheless, when accounting for even the incomplete range of known benefits through the use of static estimates that fail to capture rising values, the majority of the restoration projects we analyzed provided net benefits and should be considered not only as profitable but also as high-yielding investments.

Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants’ ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40\%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40\% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Crop pollination by wild bees is an ecosystem service of enormous value, but it is under increasing threat from agricultural intensification. As with many ecosystem services, the mechanisms, scales, and species through which crop pollination is provided are too poorly understood to inform land-use decisions. I investigated the role of tropical forest remnants as sources of pollinators to surrounding coffee crops in Costa Rica. In 2001 and 2002 I observed bee activity and pollen deposition rates at coffee flowers along distance gradients from two fragments and one narrow riparian strip of forest. Eleven eusocial species were the most common visitors: 10 species of native meliponines and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (hereafter Apis). Bee richness, overall visitation rate, and pollen deposition rate were all significantly higher in sites within approximately 100 m of forest fragments than in sites farther away (maximum distance of 1.6 km). Apis visitation rates were constant across the distance gradient, however, and Apis accounted for {\textgreater}90\% of all floral visits in distant sites. The gradient from the riparian strip showed a similar drop in bee species richness with distance, but visitation rates were uniformly low along the gradient. Throughout the study area, Apis abundances declined sharply from 2001 to 2002, reducing visitation rates by over 50\% in distant sites (where Apis was almost the only pollinator). In near sites, however, overall visitation rates dropped only 9\% because native species almost entirely compensated for the Apis decline. Forest fragments (more so than the riparian strip) thus provided nearby coffee with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of pollination services by reducing dependence on a single introduced pollinator. Exploring the economic links between forest preservation and coffee cultivation may help align the goals of conservation and agriculture within many regions of global conservation priority.},

	abstract = {Animal pollinators are globally threatened by anthropogenic land use change and agricultural intensification. The yield of many food crops is therefore negatively impacted because they benefit from biotic pollination. This is especially the case in the tropics. For instance, fruit set of Coffea arabica has been shown to increase by 10–30\% in plantations with a high richness of bee species, possibly influenced by the availability of surrounding forest habitat. Here, we performed a global literature review to (1) assess how much animal pollination enhances coffee fruit set, and to (2) examine the importance of the amount of forest cover, distance to nearby forest and forest canopy density for bee species richness and coffee fruit set. Using a systematic literature review, we identified eleven case studies with a total of 182 samples where fruit set of C. arabica was assessed. We subsequently gathered forest data for all study sites from satellite imagery. We modelled the effects of open (all forest with a canopy density of ≥25\%), closed (≥50\%) and dense (≥75\%) forests on pollinator richness and fruit set of coffee. Overall, we found that animal pollination increases coffee fruit set by {\textasciitilde}18\% on average. In only one of the case studies, regression results indicate a positive effect of dense forest on coffee fruit set, which increased with higher forest cover and shorter distance to the forest. Against expectations, forest cover and distance to open forest were not related to bee species richness and fruit set. In summary, we provide strong empirical support for the notion that animal pollinators increase coffee fruit set. Forest proximity had little overall influence on bee richness and coffee fruit set, except when farms were surrounded by dense tropical forests, potentially because these may provide high-quality habitats for bees pollinating coffee. We, therefore, advocate that more research is done to understand the biodiversity value of dense forest for pollinators, notably assessing the mechanisms underlying the importance of forest for pollinators and their pollination services.},

In 24 cases with economic estimates of services, conservation or restoration benefits (for example, greenhouse gas regulation, flood protection) tend to outweigh those private benefits (for example, profits from agriculture or logging) driving change to the alternative state. Net benefits rise rapidly with increasing social cost of carbon. Qualitative data from all 62 sites suggest that monetization of additional services would further increase the difference.

	abstract = {Environmental policies that require native vegetation conservation can be challenging to implement, especially in productive agricultural landscapes. In Brazil, the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law mandates ‘Legal Reserves’, protected native vegetation that landowners must retain on their properties. If landowners do not have the required minimum amount of native vegetation on their properties (the Legal Reserve ‘target’), they must either restore vegetation on the same property to meet the target, or compensate by protecting existing vegetation or restoring it on another property, ideally in ecologically equivalent areas. Here, we evaluate how different strategies (on-site/off-site protection and/or restoration), and different requirements for ecological equivalence when off-site strategies are used, affect the ability to achieve Legal Reserve targets, while minimising the need to restore native vegetation on productive farmland. We used a novel iterative tool to build scenarios that reflect different combinations of strategies to meet the minimum conservation target under different requirements for ecological equivalence, and compared their ability to achieve the target and their likely cost. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome where it was not possible to achieve the Legal Reserve target by protection of existing native vegetation, even when ecological equivalence rules were relaxed. As a consequence, vegetation restoration is required in this biome. Directing this required restoration to pasturelands that are less-suitable for agriculture allowed the target to be achieved in all states of Brazil, as long as only minimal ecological equivalence was required; however, for most states, the need to restore native vegetation on productive areas on farmlands could still be avoided while requiring medium to high ecological equivalence. These findings show the potential for moderate ecological equivalence to be achieved across most of Brazil in a cost-effective way and without impairing productive lands when seeking to meet the Legal Reserve targets.},

Here we have developed a novel offsetting methodological approach to balance environmental gains and land availability to support the decision-making process and negotiations among stakeholders. We applied this approach for the compensation of Legal Reserves, a percentage of native vegetation area that landowners have to set apart in their rural properties in Brazil to maintain native vegetation. If landowners do not reach the Legal Reserves requirements on their land according to the law, they may compensate it in other equivalent properties. To balance environmental gains and land availability, we have developed a dynamic tool that allows users to objectively analyze results from multiple offsetting scenarios. These scenarios can combine different levels of abiotic and biotic equivalence requirements, along with the possibility of trading up, i.e. compensating in priority natural vegetation areas and/or priority areas for restoration, even without high equivalence, with the resulting balance on land availability. The proposed approach seeks to find acceptable solutions, balancing stakeholder requirements for ecological equivalence, land availability, and possibilities of trading up. This procedure can enhance the local trade of Legal Reserves compensation, minimizing biodiversity losses, and also reducing costs. Our case study shows that it is possible to apply ecological equivalence in a balanced manner for Legal Reserve compensation. Owing to its flexibility, the proposed approach and tool can be easily adopted by other compensation schemes worldwide, supporting the negotiation and decision-making processes, to reduce biodiversity loss.},

These restored forests could sequester 2.3 GtCO2 of carbon, reduce the mean number of expected species at risk of extinction by 63.4, and reduce fragmentation by 44\% compared to current levels.

	abstract = {Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (\%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (\%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (\%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences.},

How affordable is biodiversity conservation in a fragmented landscape? Banks-Leite et al. asked this question for the biodiversity hotspot of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. An annual investment of {\textless}10\% of Brazil's agricultural subsidies could support effective ecological restoration on private lands. This would increase biodiversity in set-aside land to the same level observed in protected areas. The cost-effectiveness of this scheme suggests a path forward for conservation strategies in other similarly mixed landscapes, too.
Science, this issue p. 1041
Ecological set-asides are a promising strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes; however, landowner participation is often precluded by financial constraints. We assessed the ecological benefits and economic costs of paying landowners to set aside private land for restoration. Benefits were calculated from data on nearly 25,000 captures of Brazilian Atlantic Forest vertebrates, and economic costs were estimated for several restoration scenarios and values of payment for ecosystem services. We show that an annual investment equivalent to 6.5\% of what Brazil spends on agricultural subsidies would revert species composition and ecological functions across farmlands to levels found inside protected areas, thereby benefiting local people. Hence, efforts to secure the future of this and other biodiversity hotspots may be cost-effective.
A small portion of Brazil’s agricultural subsidies would be enough to preserve private land in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

We also argue for maintaining native habitat at higher levels where it currently exceeds the 20\% minimum, and performed a literature review that shows that even more than 50\% native habitat restoration is needed in particular landscapes.

Matrix quality should influence the location of thresholds along habitat loss gradients through its effects on connectivity; however these relationships have seldom been explored empirically. Using field data from 23 independent 1254 ha landscapes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we evaluated how tropical avian biodiversity responds to native forest loss within habitat patches embedded either in homogeneous pasture matrix context (with a high proportion of cattle pastures), and heterogeneous coffee matrix context (with high abundance of sun coffee plantations). We considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and tested if matrix type and choice of diversity metric influenced the location of biodiversity thresholds along the forest cover gradient. We found that matrix type postponed the abrupt loss of taxonomic diversity, from a threshold of 35\% of forest cover in homogeneous pasture matrix to 19\% in heterogeneous coffee matrix. Phylogenetic diversity responded similarly, with thresholds at 30 and 24\% in homogeneous-pasture and heterogeneous-coffee matrices, respectively, but no relationship with forest cover was detected when corrected for richness correlation. Despite the absence of a threshold for functional diversity in either matrix types, a strong decline below 20\% of habitat amount was detected. Finally, below 20\% native habitat loss, all diversity indices demonstrated abrupt declines, indicating that even higher-quality matrices cannot postpone diversity loss below this critical threshold. These results highlight that taxonomic diversity is a more sensitive index of biodiversity loss in fragmented landscapes, which may be used as a benchmark to prevent subsequent functional and phylogenetic losses. Furthermore, increasing matrix quality appears an efficient conservation strategy to maintain higher biodiversity levels in fragmented landscapes over a larger range of habitat loss.},

The objective of this work is to evaluate the pollination as an ecological service in agriculture, testing the hypothesis that the presence of forest remnants increases coffee agricultural productivity through an increase in pollination. This argument is based on the assumption that areas of preservation of native forest required by Brazilian law provide pollinators to local agroecosystems. Fruit production was compared among three different planting regimes: agrosilviculture, and conventional monoculture with and without preserved forest remnants nearby. The average flower production by branch was different among the farms and was not related to the planting methods. The first flowering was larger than the second, representing 81–98\% of the flowers' total production. The farms near forest fragments had an increase of 14.6\% in production that can be related to the pollinating services.},

Nonetheless, the New Forest Code (NFC) may cause economic harm, since ecosystem services may be affected, and the productivity of several crops may end up decreasing. Here, we explored two sets of factors, one at a narrow-scale – the loss of close natural vegetation cover – and another at a wide-scale considering implications at a landscape level to measure the effects of the presence/absence of forest remnants, and consequently, of pollinators, on coffee productivity. The narrow-scale perspective used manipulative experiments in ten coffee plantations, and the wide-scale perspective considered secondary data on coffee productivity in planted and native forests of 61 municipalities to test the hypotheses: i) coffee branches with pollinator access are more productive; ii) coffee crops in contact with native forest remnants are more productive; iii) coffee plants located near to native forest remnants are more productive; iv) coffee productivity increases with the municipality area occupied by native forest remnants, and, v) coffee productivity decreases with the municipality area occupied by Eucalyptus spp. At the narrow-scale, we detected 32 \% higher coffee productivity when pollinators were present (hypothesis i) and 15 \% higher productivity when forest remnants were in contact with the plantation (hypothesis ii), but no differences related to forest remnants in the broader area (hypothesis iii). At the wide-scale, we observed that a higher amount of native forest cover increased coffee productivity (hypothesis iv), while increased Eucalyptus spp. plantations reduced coffee pro­ ductivity (hypothesis v). The corroboration of hypotheses i, ii, and iv illustrates the importance of animal pollination and native vegetation remnants fr coffee productivity. The findings for hypothesis v reinforce that Eucalyptus spp. plantations are not good surrogates for native vegetation as part of management recovery action for deforested areas. Following the New Forest Code’s recommendations in Article 22 (Chapter IV, Section II), the preservation of native vegetation, species diversity, and native species regeneration should be attended to in legally instituted natural reserves. Our findings improve discernment that natural areas’ devastation or its coverage using planted forest may reduce productivity levels of coffee plantations, representing a disruption of natural complexity, of organisms’ connectivity, and consequently of ecosystem services as the pollination and pollinator-dependent crops’ productivity, as the coffee.},

In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60\% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35\% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5\% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments—when controlled for sampling effort—contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

Landscape structure affects service provision through multiple landscape-level processes, such as fragmentation, edge and connectivity effects. These processes can affect areas of ecosystem service supply and demand, and the flows linking those areas. Despite the emergence of sophisticated spatial ecosystem service assessments in the last two decades, we show through a literature review that landscape-level processes are still rarely considered in a comprehensive way. Even when they are considered, landscape effects are mostly limited to landscape composition, and configuration effects are underrepresented. Furthermore, most studies infer ecosystem service provision by only evaluating supply, ignoring demand and flows. Here we present a simple conceptual framework that illustrates how to incorporate landscape-level processes in the assessment of the different components of the service provision chain (supply, demand and flows). Using simulations, we evaluated how estimations of ecosystem service provision change when considering different landscape processes and discussed the implications of disregarding landscape effects. However, to fully implement the framework, a series of challenges linked to mapping and quantifying supply and demand, defining adequate scales of analysis, measuring flows, and parameterizing models for different types of services, still need to be overcome. To promote an adequate use and management of ecosystem services, it is essential to better incorporate landscape processes in ecosystem service assessments.

In Brazil, landowners are required to have Legal Reserves (LR) (20\%–80\% of their property set aside for native vegetation) which, if degraded, need to be restored. Alternatively, landowners can compensate for an LR deficit by purchasing surplus credits. Each landowner can define the location and spatial arrangement of their LR, affecting the reserve's ability to maintain biodiversity and provide ecosystem services (ES). We used hierarchical models to determine drivers for the amount and location of those LR in 3622 farms. The likelihood of setting aside part of the farm as LR (avoiding off-farm compensation) increased with farm size and extent of native vegetation cover, particularly for riparian areas and steep slopes, where conserving vegetation is also mandated in what are called Areas of Permanent Protection (APP). Properties with APP were more likely to meet the full LR requirement within their areas if located in areas of higher transportation costs and lower agricultural suitability. Within properties, the location of LR was mostly in areas with low agricultural suitability, high transportation cost, and close to APP. Landowners' decisions intend to maximize property income and reduce restoration costs, resulting in a spatial pattern similar to public protected areas — usually located on marginal land for agriculture. These areas do not necessarily provide the greatest biodiversity and ES benefits, suggesting that government interventions may be needed to encourage landowners to set aside native vegetation in ways that maximize conservation and ES outcomes.},

Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10–60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50\% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60\% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US\$−1, respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming.

Here, we produce spatially disaggregated marginal abatement cost curves for tropical reforestation by simulating the effects of payments for increased CO2 removals on land-cover change in 90 countries. We estimate that removals from tropical reforestation between 2020–2050 could be increased by 5.7 GtCO2 (5.6\%) at a carbon price of US \$20 CO2–1, or by 15.1 GtCO2 (14.8\%) at US\$50 tCO2–1. Ten countries comprise 55\% of potential low-cost abatement from tropical reforestation. Avoided deforestation offers 7.2–9.6 times as much potential low-cost abatement as reforestation overall (55.1 GtCO2 at US\$20 tCO2–1 or 108.3 GtCO2 at US\$50 tCO2–1), but reforestation offers more potential low-cost abatement than avoided deforestation at US\$20 tCO2–1 in 21 countries, 17 of which are in Africa.},

	abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have paramount importance with regards to hydrological and ecological functions. Despite such importance in terms of water provision, they are one of the most endangered ecosystems on the planet. One important topic that is still unclear is related to TMCF regeneration: can it recover the hydrological function of such critical ecosystems? In the present paper, the hydrological effects of the natural regeneration of TMCF were examined. We selected three catchments with different degrees of TMCF, and we examined the relationship between the amount of TMCF over time and hydrological variables such as water yields and baseflow using a time series (1984–2011). Our results suggest that the increase in TMCF cover can contribute to increases in water yield. This pattern was found in a catchment with an increase of approximately 20\% of forest cover. In catchments with TMCF increase lower than this threshold, water yield and flow path were influenced by hydroclimatic variables such as air temperature and rainfall. The effect of the reduction in water yield, in accordance with the increase in mean temperature, sheds light on possible consequences of climate change on ecosystem services produced in foggy environments. In light of these findings, aiming to increase the water yield, we recommend that regions frequently affected by fog are prioritized for forest restoration or conservation. To ensure significant effects, regeneration and/or successional development of TMCF has to reach at least 20\% of a catchment area.},

Allometric equations were used to estimate carbon stock and tree biomass, while net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period were used as economic feasibility parameters in a 16-year modeled scenario. Discount rate and carbon price applied was 6\% and US\$ 5.1 Mg CO2e-1, respectively.

	abstract = {In tropical regions, the extent of agricultural land is rapidly increasing at the expense of natural forest with associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Agroforestry has long been proposed as a more sustainable agricultural system, conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services, while providing significant local livelihood. In this context, cacao and coffee agroforestry is often regarded as more compatible with conservation of ecosystem integrity than cacao and coffee plantations. Using meta-analytical techniques and mixed models on data from 74 studies conducted across Africa, Latin America and Asia, a global quantitative synthesis was performed to assess the impact on biodiversity and on ecosystem services of (i) the conversion of natural forest into cacao and coffee agroforestry and (ii) the further intensification of agroforest into cacao and coffee plantation. Forest species richness and total species richness were significantly lower in the more intensively managed than in the more natural land use categories. Response ratios showed that the decline in total species richness was higher when comparing agroforest with plantation (−46\%), than when comparing forest with agroforest (−11\%). Biodiversity responses to intensification differed between Asia and Latin America, and between different species groups. Response ratios showed that management intensification decreased provision of ecosystem services with 37\% when comparing forest with agroforest and with 27\% when comparing agroforest with plantation. Our data suggest that species richness decline follows a concave yield function whereas ecosystem service decline follows a more convex yield function. Finally, we identified knowledge gaps related to a conspicuous lack of studies in Africa, and a general underreporting of ecosystem services and environmental variables related to agricultural intensification.},

	abstract = {Despite the high diversity of trees in the tropics, very few native species have been used in plantations. In a scenario of high international demand for nature conservation, ecological restoration and for the provision of forest products, mixed species forestry in the tropics emerges as a promising option. In this study, we examine three large experiments in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil that combine early Eucalyptus wood production with a high diversity (23–30 species) of native tree species. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) Eucalyptus growth and survival is higher in mixed plantations than in monocultures, while that of native species is lower when intercropped with Eucalyptus; (2) The diameter of target native trees is influenced by the size and by the identity of neighboring trees; (3) The negative effect of competition from Eucalyptus on native species is directly related to their growth rate. We compared mixtures of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species with Eucalyptus monocultures and with plots containing only native species, replacing Eucalyptus by ten native species. To test our hypotheses, we examined inventory data considering the stand- and the tree-levels. We calculated survival rate, diameter and height growth and basal area of whole stands and groups of species. We also used a neighborhood index analysis to separate the effect of total competition (i.e. stand density) and the influence of groups of species (intra- and inter-specific competition). The Eucalyptus trees in high diversity mixtures grew larger and yielded nearly 75\% of the basal area produced by Eucalyptus monocultures even though this genus accounted for only 50\% of seedlings in the mixtures. In the mixtures, Eucalyptus negatively affected the growth of native species proportionate to the native species’ growth rate. With some exceptions, the mixed plantations had no overall negative effect on tree survival or height growth. We conclude that mixtures of Eucalyptus and a high diversity of native tree species are feasible and represent a potential alternative for establishing multipurpose plantations, especially in the context of forest and landscape restoration.},

	abstract = {International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44\%–75\% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies.},

	abstract = {Forest loss is mainly due to the conversion of forest to agriculture, mostly in private lands. Forest restoration is a global priority, yet restoration targets are ambitious and budget-limited. Therefore, assessing the outcome of alternative decisions on land-use within private lands is paramount to perform cost-effective restoration. We present a novel framework that incorporates spatial planning for forest restoration within private lands with conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale. As a case study, we used three real landscapes of 10.000 ha with differing amounts of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, and three hypothetical animal species with different dispersal abilities. We estimated the total amount of forest that landholders must restore to comply with the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which requires landholders to reforest 20\% of their land within a 20-year time frame. We compared the cost-effectiveness of five restoration strategies based on the improvement in habitat availability and restoration costs. The most cost-effective strategy depends on a landscape’s initial amount of forest cover and the species of concern. We revealed that spatial planning for restoration in private lands increased habitat availability up to 12 times more than random restoration, which was always the least cost-effective strategy. Cost-effective large-scale restoration in Brazil depends on public policies that assist landholders to comply with the law and on prioritizing areas for restoration within private lands. We show that by adding habitat availability as target in spatial prioritization, benefits for biodiversity can be hastened at low additional cost, even in real world scenarios with severe spatial constraints. Despite constraints, spatially planned restoration for law compliance in Brazil increased landscape permeability by creating corridors and stepping stones. Our framework should be used to plan restoration in Brazilian private lands and can be customized for other regions worldwide.},

The objective of this work was to develop high-resolution grids (0.25∘ × 0.25∘) of daily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the five climate variables generally required to estimate evapostranspiration for Brazil. These five variables are maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. We tested six different interpolation schemes to create the grids for these variables. The data were obtained from 3625 rain gauge and 735 weather stations for period of 1980–2013. We used a cross-validation approach that compares point observed data to point interpolated estimates to select the best interpolation scheme for each climate variable. We also present the performance of the best interpolation for each climate variable at daily timescales and for river basins. The inverse distance weighting and angular distance weighting methods produced the best results. Performance of all methods was poorer prior to 1995 because of fewer stations and available data. The performance of the interpolation varies for different seasons for almost all variables. Forecasting capability was tested for precipitation only and performed adequately for the system state (wet or dry). Variations in the interpolation schemes across river basins are primarily attributed to differences in gauge or station network density. This freely available gridded meteorological data set significantly advances the availability of climate data in Brazil.},

Accurate estimation of fragmentation effects should account for additive edge effects and edge age. Here we investigated those effects on C stock and forest structure (density, height, basal area) in fragments (13 to 362ha) of forest with≥70years old, surrounded by pasture, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest region. We measured 5297 stems sampled in four categories replicated in eight fragments: fragment interiors ({\textgreater}110m from edges); old ({\textgreater}50years) corner edges ({\textless} 50m); old straight edges; and new (ca. 44years) straight edges. Aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and diameter at breast height, and converted to carbon. Carbon stock was highly variable between categories, scoring from 10.44Mgha−1 up to 107.59Mgha−1 (average of 41.27±23Mgha−1). Contrary to our expectations, interior plots did not have higher carbon stock, basal area or tree stem density than edges, but only taller trees. We found no significant effects of edge age or additive edge effects on carbon stocks. These results suggest that edge effects in the Atlantic rainforest may differ from those observed in more recently fragmented tropical forests, such as the Amazonian forest. We hypothesize that in heavily human-modified landscapes, more extensive edge effects combined with other human disturbances on tree mortality and carbon stock may contribute to overall high levels of degradation, reducing differences between edge and interior habitats. Existing models based on Amazonian forest data may underestimate the true impacts of fragmentation on carbon storage in landscapes with an old history of human disturbance.},

However, relationships between above- and belowground carbon stocks with secondary forest age and specific soil nutrients remain unclear. Current global estimates for CO2 uptake and sequestration in secondary tropical forests focus on aboveground biomass and are parameterised using relatively coarse metrics of soil fertility. Here, we estimate total carbon stocks across a chronosequence of regenerating secondary forest stands (40–120 years old) in Panama, and assess the relationships between both above- and belowground carbon stocks with stand age and specific soil nutrients. We estimated carbon stocks in aboveground biomass, necromass, root biomass, and soil. We found that the two largest carbon pools – aboveground biomass and soil – have distinct relationships with stand age and soil fertility. Aboveground biomass contained {\textasciitilde}61–97 Mg C ha−1 (24–39\% total carbon stocks) and significantly increased with stand age, but showed no relationship with soil nutrients. Soil carbon stocks contained {\textasciitilde}128–206 Mg C ha−1 (52–70\% total stocks) and were unrelated to stand age, but were positively related to soil nitrogen. Root biomass carbon stocks tracked patterns exhibited by aboveground biomass. Necromass carbon stocks did not increase with stand age, but stocks were held in larger pieces of deadwood in older stands. Comparing our estimates to published data from younger and older secondary forests in the surrounding landscape, we show that soil carbon recovers within 40 years of forest regeneration, but aboveground biomass carbon stocks continue to increase past 100 years. Above- and belowground carbon stocks appear to be decoupled in secondary tropical forests. Paired measures of above- and belowground carbon stocks are necessary to reduce uncertainty in large-scale models of atmospheric CO2 uptake and storage by secondary forests.},

Restoration scientists and practitioners are now on the frontline and will be increasingly called upon to get involved in large scale programs addressing immediate environmental crises and challenges. Here, we summarize the advances in mainstreaming ecological restoration in global environmental policy deliberations during the last year, culminating in the recent meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. We also provide key references for those seeking more information, and set out an agenda as to how the restoration community could respond to and act upon these recent developments. However, we underline the need for caution and prudence; we must not promise more than we can deliver. Thirty years after the emergence of ecological restoration as a scientific discipline and practice, there remain many obstacles and misconceptions about what can be achieved at large scales. Yet, clearly the old adage applies here: nothing ventured, nothing gained.},

However, the knowledge base for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration (FLR) needs further development. Besides application of scientific and local knowledge, a broad understanding of the social, economic, and environmental context in which this knowledge is being applied is also needed. To address knowledge gaps and guide implementation of FLR at local to global scales we propose a knowledge creation agenda that we derive from emerging policy goals. We present a holistic approach that addresses food security, ecosystem services, and livelihoods, and that supports implementation by a wide array of actors from farmers and municipalities to corporations and state agencies. Our knowledge creation agenda is based on six broad policy goals, with several associated knowledge gaps for each goal. We recognize that this agenda is simply a starting point and will surely evolve and become more locally focused as the concept of FLR gains ground and as multiple groups of stakeholders engage in the long-term process of restoring functionality and value to ecosystems and landscapes around the world.},

	abstract = {1. The development of ecological networks could enhance the ability of species to disperse across fragmented landscapes and could mitigate against the negative impacts of climate change. The development of such networks will require widespread ecological restoration at the landscape scale, which is likely to be costly. However, little information is available regarding the cost-effectiveness of restoration approaches. 2. We address this knowledge gap by examining the potential impact of landscape-scale habitat restoration on the value of multiple ecosystem services across the catchment of the River Frome in Dorset, England. This was achieved by mapping the market value of four ecosystem services (carbon storage, crops, livestock and timber) under three different restoration scenarios, estimating restoration costs, and calculating net benefits. 3. The non-market value of additional services (cultural, aesthetic and recreational value) was elicited from local stakeholders using an online survey tool. Flood risk was assessed using a scoring approach. Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) was conducted, incorporating both market and non-market values, to evaluate the relative benefits of restoration scenarios. These were compared with impacts of restoration on biodiversity value. 4. Multi-Criteria Analysis results consistently ranked restoration scenarios above a non-restoration comparator, reflecting the increased provision of multiple ecosystem services. Restoration scenarios also provided benefits to biodiversity, in terms of increased species richness and habitat connectivity. However, restoration costs consistently exceeded the market value of ecosystem services. 5. Synthesis and applications. Establishment of ecological networks through ecological restoration is unlikely to deliver net economic benefits in landscapes dominated by agricultural land use. This reflects the high costs of ecological restoration in such landscapes. The cost-effectiveness of ecological networks will depend on how the benefits provided to people are valued, and on how the value of non-market benefits are weighted against the costs of reduced agricultural and timber production. Future plans for ecological restoration should incorporate local stakeholder values, to ensure that benefits to people are maximised.},

Our meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest restoration enhances biodiversity by 15-84\% and vegetation structure by 36-77\%, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

We assessed whether restoration scientists and practitioners use their projects to demonstrate the beneﬁts restoration can provide in their peer-reviewed publications. We evaluated a sample of the academic literature to determine whether links are made explicit between ecological restoration, society, and public policy related to natural capital. We analyzed 1,582 peer-reviewed papers dealing with ecological restoration published between 1 January 2000 and 30 September 2008 in 13 leading scientiﬁc journals. As selection criterion, we considered papers that contained either “restoration” or “rehabilitation” in their title, abstract, or keywords. Furthermore, as one-third of the papers were published in Restoration Ecology, we used that journal as a reference for comparison with all the other journals. We readily acknowledge that aquatic ecosystems are under-represented, and that the largely inaccessible gray literature was ignored. Within these constraints, we found clear evidence that restoration practitioners are failing to signal links between ecological restoration, society, and policy, and are underselling the evidence of beneﬁts of restoration as a worthwhile investment for society. We discuss this assertion and illustrate it with samples of our ﬁndings—with regards to (1) the geographical and institutional afﬁliations of authors; (2) the choice of ecosystems studied, methods employed, monitoring schemes applied, and the spatial scale of studies; and (3) weak links to payments for ecosystem service setups, agriculture, and ramiﬁcations for public policy.},

Using Brazil’s example of a key exporter of forest-risk commodities, here we show that it has ∼3.25 Mha of natural habitat (storing ∼152.8 million tons of potential CO2 emissions) at a high risk of legal deforestation until 2025. Additionally, the country’s legal framework is going through modifications to legalize agricultural production in illegally deforested areas. What was illegal may become legal shortly. Hence, a legality criterion adopted by consumer countries is insufficient to protect forests and other ecosystems and may worsen deforestation and conversion risks by incentivizing the weakening of social-environmental protection by producer countries.},

By providing a bail out to landowners with illegal deforestation, the New Forest Code has created incentives for law-abiding landowners to engage in deforestation activities as well, in the expectation of receiving future amnesties. To identify causal effects, we explore a rich dataset at the property level and use a difference-in-differences strategy, where former law-abiders are our treatment group. In our preferred econometric specification, the private rural properties in the treated group are associated with a rate of forest loss 0.457 p.p. higher than would prevail in the absence of the law revision. This amounts to an accumulated loss of nearly 1 million hectares of forest between 2012 and 2017. This is equivalent to a US\$ 2.4 billion loss when no more than carbon emissions are considered.},

We describe how the economic and policy context creates barriers for the development, persistence, and management of naturally regenerating forests, including perverse outcomes of policies intended to enhance protection of native forests. We conclude with recommendations for specific economic and policy interventions at local, national, and global scales to enhance forest natural regeneration and to promote the sustainable management of regrowth forests on former agricultural land while strengthening rural communities and economies.},

	abstract = {Native vegetation in private lands plays an important role in providing ecosystem services and safeguarding biodiversity worldwide. Legal protection rules of this vegetation are thus crucial. In Brazil, since 1934, there has been a requirement for landowners to preserve a percentage of their land covered with native vegetation, the Legal Reserve. However, the 1934 legislation applies only to arboreal vegetation, while the protection of sa­ vannahs and grasslands begins after 1965 and 1989. The reference year for the application of Legal Reserves can thus have significant impacts on the amount of native vegetation legally protected. Here we tested the effects on Legal Reserve cover in Sa˜o Paulo State, considering two different legal benchmarks as starting points: 1934 and 1965. Given that the 1934 law precedes the first aerial mapping in Brazil, we developed a methodology to es­ timate past native vegetation cover through a probabilistic approach. The forest deficit considering 1934 as the initial point is 3\% lower than the one starting with the 1965 benchmark. Comparing both scenarios, the 1934 led to a reduction of 1255 farms with Legal Reserve deficit from a total of 30,417. For both scenarios, Legal Reserve deficits were concentrated in the West, Northwest, and Mid-west regions of the state. The outcomes showed that the benchmark change does not significantly affect the total area of Legal Reserves protection, the number of farms potentially benefited by this mechanism, and the amount of native vegetation deficit. However, the use of the 1934 as an initial date for considering protection of Legal Reserve can delay the implementation of the law due to a time-consuming farm-by-farm analysis, once the probabilistic map has an intrinsic limitation for an automatic process. Thus, the environmental gains with the adoption of 1934 as the initial date do not overcome the limitations of using a probabilistic map, suggesting that effective law enforcement depends on reliable and more recent baselines, allowing semi-automated analyses. This scientific evidence can be adopted by the other Brazilian States that have not yet defined the initial legal benchmark, balancing the advantages and disadvan­ tages of adopting the 1934 Forest Act.},

Previous scholars have indicated the necessity of investigating the concept of value co-creation further by including various stakeholder perspectives and suggesting systems of evaluation. This research thus focuses on low-power smallholder farmers within the coffee supply chain by qualitatively evaluating the effectiveness of value co-creation projects. The study also analyzes the extent of development and the nature of empowerment initiatives designed conjointly by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and coffee roasters that are addressed to farmers. The mixed qualitative methodology includes a literature review, interviews, focus groups, and content analysis of 20 value co-creation projects conducted in various developing and emerging coffee-producing countries. The research proposes a theoretical framework employed to conduct focus groups with Brazilian coffee farmers. This framework empirically demonstrates that these farmers are in the process of becoming business partners of the coffee supply chain thanks to various empowerment initiatives, common to most of the analyzed projects, that appear to moderate specific vulnerabilities of the coffee supply chain and therefore benefit supply chain resilience.},

	abstract = {Annual forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon had in 2012 declined to less than 5,000 sqkm, from over 27,000 in 2004. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that changes in Brazilian law enforcement strategy and the related governance system may account for a large share of the overall success in curbing deforestation rates. At the same time, Brazil is experimenting with alternative approaches to compensate farmers for conservation actions through economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services, at various administrative levels. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model for deforestation decisions in response to policy incentives and disincentives. The model builds on elements of optimal enforcement theory and introduces the notion of imperfect payment contract enforcement in the context of avoided deforestation. We implement the simulations using official deforestation statistics and data collected from field-based forest law enforcement operations in the Amazon region. We show that a large-scale integration of payments with the existing regulatory enforcement strategy involves a tradeoff between the cost-effectiveness of forest conservation and landholder incomes. Introducing payments as a complementary policy measure increases policy implementation cost, reduces income losses for those hit hardest by law enforcement, and can provide additional income to some land users. The magnitude of the tradeoff varies in space, depending on deforestation patterns, conservation opportunity and enforcement costs. Enforcement effectiveness becomes a key determinant of efficiency in the overall policy mix.},
