## Abstract

Restoration is a critical tool for reversing biodiversity declines and mitigating climate change. However, it is a costly intervention. Where restoration provides significant financial benefits, such as by increasing crop yield or providing carbon credits, these costs may be offset. Focusing on a restoration hotspot in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we develop restoration scenarios and calculate estimations of their financial balance to understand conditions where restoration costs might be compensated by yield and carbon credit-derived benefits. Our study suggests that restoration costs can be offset by yield increases when farms already have >10% forest cover and restoration targets are below 25% forest cover. Current $CO_2$ price is not sufficient in offsetting net costs for higher restoration targets. A carbon value of 35-124 USD/ton would be required to promote restoration. The identification of balanced financial conditions, that create landscapes suitable for biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation, and agricultural production, has broader implications and is strategic to scale up restoration.  

## Introduction

Habitat loss [@tilman_future_2017] and climate change [@foden_identifying_2013]  threaten biodiversity globally, but clear restoration targets can greatly reduce species extinction risk [@leclere_bending_2020;@strassburg_global_2020] and simultaneously improve biodiversity conservation and human wellbeing[@barral_quantifying_2015; @benayas_enhancement_2009; @bullock_long-term_2007; @rey_benayas_restoration_2012; @shimamoto_how_2014; @wade_ecological_2008]. Many countries have made ambitious restoration commitments for the current UN decade on restoration, including to restore 350 Mha of degraded land by 2030 under the Bonn Challenge [@erbaugh_global_2020]. However, these actions face important difficulties to be implemented given the high costs involved. These include direct restoration costs, fencing and opportunity cost of forgone production.  Recent work has highlighted that these costs can act as a major financial barrier to the wide-scale adoption of restoration [@brancalion_what_2019; groot_benefits_2013].

However as well as costs, farmland restoration can also deliver ecosystem service and yield benefits, e.g. via crop pollination and pest control. In some cases, these benefits can be substantial, such as for coffee production. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of landscape native vegetation cover and the proximity between coffee fields and natural areas in modulating the flows of pollinators and natural pest controllers, which can increase coffee yield by 10 to 30% [@aristizabal_landscape_2019; @gonzalez-chaves_forest_2020; @libran-embid_effects_2017; @ricketts_economic_2004; @roubik_value_2002; @saturni_landscape_2016; @moreaux_value_2022].   Restoration also can deliver large carbon benefits. Restored tropical secondary forests have the potential to sequester an average of 3.05 tons of carbon ha-1 year-1 from the atmosphere throughout 20 years [@poorter_biomass_2016]. Carbon stock is a critical regulation service that benefits people globally and can be traded in carbon markets, helping to compensate restoration costs. Yet, from our knowledge, few studies [@bradbury_economic_2021] have incorporated the benefits of restoration in farmlands to the cost analyses, nor have they explored the situations under which these benefits may prove substantial enough to overcome costs.  Once the effects of restoration on yield and in farm income can offset at least partially restoration costs, understanding the factors that play a role in this cost/benefit balance is key to inform landowners and support decision making and agri-environmental policies. 

Here, we explore how much, and under which conditions, benefits from ecosystem restoration can offset costs. We do so in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a globally iconic biome [@laurance_conserving_2009], a restoration hotspot [@brancalion_global_2019], and one of the leading coffee regions of Brazil. Coffee is among the top 20 commodities traded globally [@fao_top_2019] and Brazil is its major producer and exporter. We developed a set of scenarios with different on-farm restoration targets and calculated a detailed estimation of their financial consequences to understand how and when the costs of ecological restoration might be compensated by restoration-derived yield benefits, carbon credits, and agricultural credit lines. We have combined ecological data on how restoring natural habitats can improve ecosystem service provision with economic assessments on the balance of restoration costs and benefits. Our work can provide a framework for identifying circumstances where restoration benefits can outstrip costs, helping meet global restoration commitments and to promote restoration within agricultural landscapes.  

## Study system and scenario construction

Restoration commitments in Brazil are guided by a legal obligation dictated by the Native Vegetation Protection Law (Law 12.651/2012), which drives and enforces how, where and how much native vegetation should be conserved, managed, or restored within farms [@mello_achieving_2021; @mello_integrating_2021]. All rural properties within the Atlantic Forest must have a minimum of 20% of the area set aside as natural vegetation. This is composed of Areas of Permanent Protection (APP), whose location is defined by the legislation (environmentally sensitive areas, such as riparian areas, hilltops, and steep slopes) and Legal Reserves allocated by landowners to achieve the minimum set-aside target of 20%. Farmers who do not have the mandatory area covered with natural vegetation must restore it within 20 years, or in the case of Legal Reserves, opt for a compensation scheme outside their property – e.g. trading with landowners with Legal Reserves surplus [@mello_achieving_2021; @mello_integrating_2021]. The spatial information concerning farm boundaries and set-aside areas is uploaded to an environmental rural register platform named CAR (Portuguese acronym), a public access database.

To analyze the cost-benefit relationship incurred by restoration actions, we designed 8 scenarios with a time window of 20 years, based on the Native Vegetation Protection Law, and more ambitious commitments (Methods). Our **baseline scenario** represents the 2017 land-use and land-cover situation. In four additional scenarios, we set forest cover targets at the farm-level, ranging from 10-40% with 10% increment, including targets above the 20% required by the law (**farm-level restoration scenarios**). Finally, to test the performance of designating restorations at a regional instead of farm-scale, we simulated three **regional-level restoration scenarios** where we combined the area of all focal farms and set three targets (20, 30, and 40%) so that the combined farms-area would have achieved the defined target at the regional scale. This regional approach favors restoration within farms with lower restoration costs in the region, while high-cost farms compensate for their forest deficit. For the farm and regional level scenarios, we used a prioritization algorithm [@hanson_prioritizr_2020] that applies linear programming to find optimal solutions to achieve the targets, whilst minimizing restoration costs incurred by farmers. 

The scenarios were applied to 507 farms from 58 municipalities selected in one of the most traditional areas for coffee production in the country (Figure \@ref(fig:studysite)), responsible for 22% of the national production and ~7% of the global production (2019 data from the International Coffee Organization and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-IBGE). This region is within the Atlantic Rainforest biome, recognized as one of the world's largest biodiversity hotspots. Our focused farms ranged from 7-2,000 ha in size (mean= 233 ha).

We estimated the immediate cost of allocating areas for restoration as a sum of restoration costs and the opportunity cost of foregone production (Supplementary Figure B1), hereafter named total restoration costs. Restoration costs for the 20 years were estimated using a 30 m resolution raster containing the probability of natural regeneration or the necessity of actively planting seedlings [@crouzeilles_achieving_2019] and costs with restoration from projects within the Atlantic Rainforest [@brancalion_what_2019] (Methods). The forgone production was calculated as a combination of the net present value over 20 years of the main crops grown in the region and the spatial distribution of crops and pasture (see Methods for details). We also explored consequences of restoration scenarios on coffee production, accounting for changes in area under production and changes in coffee yield, which we parameterized using a  coffee-yield model relating landscape metrics to coffee productivity (Methods). This model, allowed us to realistically forecast restoration-derived changes in yield outcomes.

We also considered compensation payments, based on the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which established a market for Legal Reserves (Methods). Total restoration costs, opportunity cost based on our yield model, and compensation payments were combined and will hereafter be referred to as total intervention costs. For carbon sequestration calculation, we used literature data to estimate aboveground [@poorter_biomass_2016] and belowground [@zanini_effect_2021] carbon sequestered over 20 years in each scenario (Methods). 

## Results

Opportunity cost and restoration cost increased substantially with the proportion of area targeted for restoration (Figure \@ref(fig:painel) a and b; Supplementary Figure B2a and B2b), mostly due to the increasing coffee area converted to forest (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)c; Supplementary Figure B2c). Most scenarios had a marginal increase in yield in comparison with the baseline scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)d; Supplementary Figure B2d). However, for scenarios with restoration targets >20%, yield increases did not increase total production enough (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)e; Supplementary Figure B2e) to compensate for the replacement of coffee-planted areas with forest. Scenarios rl30 and rl40 had an unexpected average decrease in yield.  Those later scenarios resulted in concentrated forest patches, favoring situations of high forest cover (>50%) and very low coffee cover (<10%) (Supplementary Figure B3), even though the average distance from the nearest forest did not vary significantly among scenarios (Supplementary Figure B4). Farms in a similar situation used to build our predictive yield model had lower yield (Supplementary Figure B5), which can be a consequence of a lower productivity potential where they are located (see Supplementary Material), as described previously in the Atlantic Forest region [@gonzalez-chaves_positive_2021].

There were three scenarios for which we did not find reductions in production after 20 years and where coffee yield showed a slight increase (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)e; Supplementary Figure B2e): fl10, fl20, and rl20. Under these scenarios, restoration actions were more advantageous economically, and the relationship between costs and benefits was more balanced (Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). In addition to the changes in production, we also computed forest compensation costs and gains – when farmers trade their Legal Reserve surplus and deficit to achieve legal compliance (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)f-g; Supplementary Figure B2f-g). However, compensation schemes represented a small fraction of the cash flow associated with the interventions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)), which were predominantly a result of changes in production, suggesting that losing coffee areas was the main financial challenge posed by restoration in the region.


```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Proportional of the cash flow represented by the intervention costs.

```



The overall financial balance for all scenarios was negative. For example, achieving legal compliance enforcing farm-level forest cover (fl20) without offsite compensation would imply an average cost of USD 63,719 per farm, or around USD 32 million in total to add ~ 12 thousand ha of forest above the baseline (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)a). However, when we considered the farm’s forest cover at the baseline, we found that for farms that already had at least 10% forest cover, yield increase outweighed total intervention costs for some scenarios. As a result, there was an average increase of up to a 1.7% in net income in comparison with the baseline scenario for scenarios fl10 ,fl20, and rl20 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)b; Supplementary Figure B6). For farms with forest cover below 10%, total intervention costs outweighed potential benefits with yield increase (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)c). These results suggest that for our study region, compliance with the Native Vegetation Protection Law would have net financial gains for farms with > 10% of forest cover. However, farms with <10% forest cover and scenarios with more ambitious restoration targets (>20%) had 3 to 16.6% decrease in farm income, reflecting the negative net change in production and the high restoration costs.

```

Regional-level scenarios on average led to lower net costs compared to farm-level scenarios, but with less area restored. Interestingly, the regional approach enables legal compliance with lower costs even with compensation schemes concentrated on the region (“local market”), while the farm-level approach favors a higher forest cover (around 25% of the region; Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)a and Supplementary Figure B6) and a lower degree of fragmentation (in total number of fragments), but with forest cover more concentrated in smaller forest patches (Figure \@ref(fig:fig5)). In farm-level scenarios, restoration tends to be done in small areas and as an extension of existing fragments. With a 20% target – which would guarantee legal compliance without compensation outside our study region – the regional approach had an average cash flow 14% higher than the farm-level approach but restored nearly half the area (6,600 ha vs. 11,940 ha; Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)a). This is because to meet a regional target, only 7% of additional forests were required, once remnant forest areas at the farms already summed 14% of the region at the baseline.  On the contrary, for farms with >10% forest cover, the farm-level approach (fl20) had a higher cash flow (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)b) and is the win-win scenario, in which both benefits and forest cover are maximized.

Compliance with the Native Vegetation Protection law has the potential to remove 2,6-4,2 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere in our focal farms, which would require USD ~283-312 million investment to compensate net costs (Figure \@ref(fig:fig6 )). If we assume a carbon value at current levels (~4 dollars/ton) [@donofrio_voluntary_2020], our focal farms would have access to ~ USD 10 – 43 million of restoration compensation, depending on the scenario. This represents a  small fraction (~3-11%) of net intervention costs. To offset net restoration costs with carbon markets, we estimate that the ton of CO2 would have to be traded between USD 35-124, depending on the scenario. While the amount of carbon sequestered had a four-fold increase from lower (10%) to higher (40%) forest cover target scenarios, the total net costs increased only 1.36 fold. As a consequence, the estimated value of carbon to offset restoration costs turned out to be higher in low to intermediate forest cover scenarios (fl10 and, particularly, rl20).

With net costs and carbon sequestered, we estimated the carbon value to offset restoration costs (c)."}

## Discussion

Our scenarios suggest that over 20 years, the costs of forest restoration within farms --  including direct costs, opportunity costs, and changes in production -- can be offset by ecosystem services benefits when restoration results in coffee yield increases. This offset condition occurs particularly when farms have >10% forest cover at the baseline. Those farmers who had historically deforested a smaller fraction of their land and had smaller legal forest cover deficits had a net financial benefit in complying with legal restoration mandates, whereas farmers who had deforested more land faced a financial burden. There is a clear threshold around 25% forest cover above which additional restoration substantially increases costs; more ambitious restoration targets (30% or more) resulted in a net financial loss for farmers up to 16% of farm’s income. When comparing the cost-benefit of targeting restoration on the farm with a regional planning approach, we found that while a regional approach favored achieving restoration targets with smaller costs, targeting restoration at the farm level has led to disproportionally higher forest cover and even a higher net benefit (when farms had >10% forest cover on the baseline).  

The 25% forest cover threshold is near the 30% biodiversity extinction threshold for the Atlantic Forest [@banks-leite_using_2014], and within the required range of vegetation cover needed to maintain biodiversity in working landscapes [20-40%; @garibaldi_working_2020; @arroyorodriguez_designing_2020]. For more permeable matrices such as coffee, the threshold is estimated to be closer to 20% [@boesing_biodiversity_2018]. Our results support the feasibility of maintaining this minimal amount of native vegetation– around 25% [@garibaldi_working_2020; @arroyorodriguez_designing_2020] –- suggesting the more economically advantageous restoration scenarios may be enough in reducing extinction debts for threatened biodiversity in those landscapes.  The cost of reaching this target can be offset by the benefits of restoration, at least in some scenarios. The compliance with the Native Vegetation Protection Law could thus not only contribute to reducing extinction risk but also can provide economic benefits through productivity gains mediated by ecosystem services provision. Furthermore, the restoration-mediated benefits to yield we observed on our farms may be higher in other regions. Our focused municipalities already have high forest cover surrounding coffee fields, which were on average closer to forest patches in comparison to other areas (Supplementary Figure B7a). Coffee yield on local experiments was estimated to be 15-20.8 % higher on fields closer (< 800 m) [@ricketts_economic_2004; marco_services_2004] or in contact with forests [@latini_reconciling_2020]. Some municipalities elsewhere also grow pollinator-dependent C. canephora, which is expected to be more sensitive to pollination supply increase mediated by forests [@gonzalez-chaves_positive_2021](Supplementary Figure B7b). Thus, our results are likely to be conservative estimates of derivable restoration benefits.

Beyond coffee, several other crops are benefited by ecosystem services and are likely to have positive yield effects from an increase in forested areas within agricultural landscapes. Taking pollination as an example, for which the benefits for agriculture are more evident,  crops such as soybean, rapeseed, apples, and many other fruits depend on this service [@klein_importance_2007].  Globally, pollination contributes to ~70% of the leading food crops, which account for ~35% of all production [@klein_importance_2007]. In Brazil, the economic contribution of pollination represents 30% of the total annual agricultural income with pollinator-dependent crops, half of it from soybean [@giannini_dependence_2015]. This way, our findings have broader implications for other systems across the world.

### Farm-level vs. regional approach

We found that a regional planning restoration governance tool was a useful restoration strategy for farms with low forest cover (<10%) to achieve the 20% target.  In such a situation, the regional approach had a more advantageous cash flow in comparison with the farm-level approach for the same target. This was true even with compensation schemes – when landowners with farms below 20% forest cover pay to compensate their forest debt elsewhere – concentrated on the region. Regional planning also favored larger and more concentrated forest patches, which can be beneficial for biodiversity [@chase_ecosystem_2020]. Currently, there are no established mechanisms for regional planning [@mello_integrating_2021] –- for instance, farmers are allowed to trade Legal Reserves across the entire Atlantic Forest. However, our results indicate that restoration planning would still be cost-effective if applied on a more regional scale. Moreover, whilst our prioritization approach only minimized costs, regional policies could also better design landscapes additionally increasing yield gains, creating landscapes to optimize service provision too.  

On the other hand, we found the farm-level approach resulted in an overall larger forest amount, more evenly spread among the farms. For less sensitive species, habitat amount per se, even spread into a mosaic of forest patches, can be more important than fragment size [@arroyorodriguez_designing_2020]. Similarly, for ecosystem services provided by mobile organisms, we expect this approach to be better by reducing the distance between natural areas towards crops [@metzger_considering_2021; @mitchell_reframing_2015]. It would also reduce natural vegetation location bias exclusively on marginal areas for agriculture, which does not necessarily overlap with priority areas for conservation [@brancalion_global_2019; @d_albertas_private_2021].  

### Carbon credit and additional governance actions

Although we estimate that there can be economic benefits with restoration, they are relatively long-term while the costs are immediate, which can discourage farmers from restoring their land. Carbon markets can be a complementary strategy to stimulate farmers to set aside land for conservation. However, current CO_2 prices averaging 4 USD per ton [@]1 would not be enough to offset intervention net costs. This value would have to rise to USD 72-124 per ton for legal compliance (around 20% forest cover), and USD 38-47 for more ambitious scenarios (>30% forest cover). This cost range is considerably higher than previous estimates about the value required to offset restoration projects within the Atlantic Forest (USD 18-20 per ton of CO2 removed) [@]47, reflecting the elevated opportunity cost of our study region. Nevertheless, they converge with estimates demonstrating that higher carbon prices (USD 20-50) will be needed to help make tropical forest restoration economically balanced in costs and benefits for landowners [@]48,49. Another relevant aspect to consider is that the net cash balance is not homogeneously distributed among farms, making fixed carbon prices unfair. A better strategy would be to remunerate farmers proportionally to their restoration expenditures, though such policy would require a technical and socioeconomic challenge of paying neighbors different values according to their expected net expenditures with restoration.

It is also important to increase the offer of financial options for restoration, especially to account for other ecosystem services [@barral_quantifying_2015; @benayas_enhancement_2009; @wade_ecological_2008], such as increased soil quality [@]6 and water supply [@]50. Policies to account for multiple ecosystem services, such as payment for ecosystem services, must be considered, in which case restoration is expected to deliver net benefits [@de_groot_benefits_2013; @bradbury_economic_2021]. Additionally, a large portion of the costs incurred with the interventions was related to changes in production due to agricultural land being converted to forest, without any revenue. Our restoration simulation focused on native forests, but the expansion of coffee agroforestry systems (instead of restoring only native forests) can be profitable [@goncalves_potential_2021] and still host 65% more species richness than plantations[@de_beenhouwer_global_2013]. A mixed scheme, with forests and agroforestry, would help dilute restoration costs. A consortium of commercial eucalyptus trees for wood production mixed with native species is also a viable option [@amazonas_high_2018] and can reduce restoration costs by 44-75% [@brancalion_exotic_2020].

## Conclusion

Our results show that for a traditional coffee-producing region within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a command-and-control governance tool to enforce restoration within farms does not necessarily incur financial losses.  Depending on the initial vegetation cover and the target to be reached, it can even provide marginal benefits for farmers besides contributing to the maintenance of biodiversity in working landscapes and helping to capture a relevant amount of carbon. However, additional policies such as carbon markets and financing restoration activities are vital to make restoration action broadly feasible and immediately attractive for farmers. This illustrative study case on how target restoration will impact agricultural production on working landscapes in tropical regions can be applied and expanded to other landscapes worldwide to understand how much and in which conditions benefit from ecosystem restoration can offset costs.
