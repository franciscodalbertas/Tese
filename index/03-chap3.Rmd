## Abstract

Restoration is a critical tool for reversing biodiversity declines and mitigating climate change. However, it is a costly intervention. Where restoration provides significant financial benefits, such as by increasing crop yield or providing carbon credits, these costs may be offset. Focusing on a restoration hotspot in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we develop restoration scenarios and calculate estimations of their financial balance to understand conditions where restoration costs might be compensated by yield and carbon credit-derived benefits. Our study suggests that restoration costs can be offset by yield increases when farms already have >10% forest cover and restoration targets are below 25% forest cover. Current $CO_2$ price is not sufficient in offsetting net costs for higher restoration targets. A carbon value of 35-124 USD/ton would be required to promote restoration. The identification of balanced financial conditions, that create landscapes suitable for biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation, and agricultural production, has broader implications and is strategic to scale up restoration.  

## Introduction

Habitat loss [@tilman_future_2017] and climate change [@foden_identifying_2013]  threaten biodiversity globally, but clear restoration targets can greatly reduce species extinction risk [@leclere_bending_2020;@strassburg_global_2020] and simultaneously improve biodiversity conservation and human wellbeing[@barral_quantifying_2015; @benayas_enhancement_2009; @bullock_long-term_2007; @rey_benayas_restoration_2012; @shimamoto_how_2014; @wade_ecological_2008]. Many countries have made ambitious restoration commitments for the current UN decade on restoration, including to restore 350 Mha of degraded land by 2030 under the Bonn Challenge [@erbaugh_global_2020]. However, these actions face important difficulties to be implemented given the high costs involved. These include direct restoration costs, fencing and opportunity cost of forgone production.  Recent work has highlighted that these costs can act as a major financial barrier to the wide-scale adoption of restoration [@brancalion_what_2019; groot_benefits_2013].

However as well as costs, farmland restoration can also deliver ecosystem service and yield benefits, e.g. via crop pollination and pest control. In some cases, these benefits can be substantial, such as for coffee production. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of landscape native vegetation cover and the proximity between coffee fields and natural areas in modulating the flows of pollinators and natural pest controllers, which can increase coffee yield by 10 to 30% [@aristizabal_landscape_2019; @gonzalez-chaves_forest_2020; @libran-embid_effects_2017; @ricketts_economic_2004; @roubik_value_2002; @saturni_landscape_2016; @moreaux_value_2022].   Restoration also can deliver large carbon benefits. Restored tropical secondary forests have the potential to sequester an average of 3.05 tons of carbon ha-1 year-1 from the atmosphere throughout 20 years [@poorter_biomass_2016]. Carbon stock is a critical regulation service that benefits people globally and can be traded in carbon markets, helping to compensate restoration costs. Yet, from our knowledge, few studies [@bradbury_economic_2021] have incorporated the benefits of restoration in farmlands to the cost analyses, nor have they explored the situations under which these benefits may prove substantial enough to overcome costs.  Once the effects of restoration on yield and in farm income can offset at least partially restoration costs, understanding the factors that play a role in this cost/benefit balance is key to inform landowners and support decision making and agri-environmental policies. 

Here, we explore how much, and under which conditions, benefits from ecosystem restoration can offset costs. We do so in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a globally iconic biome [@laurance_conserving_2009], a restoration hotspot [@brancalion_global_2019], and one of the leading coffee regions of Brazil. Coffee is among the top 20 commodities traded globally [@fao_top_2019] and Brazil is its major producer and exporter. We developed a set of scenarios with different on-farm restoration targets and calculated a detailed estimation of their financial consequences to understand how and when the costs of ecological restoration might be compensated by restoration-derived yield benefits, carbon credits, and agricultural credit lines. We have combined ecological data on how restoring natural habitats can improve ecosystem service provision with economic assessments on the balance of restoration costs and benefits. Our work can provide a framework for identifying circumstances where restoration benefits can outstrip costs, helping meet global restoration commitments and to promote restoration within agricultural landscapes.  

## Study system and scenario construction

Restoration commitments in Brazil are guided by a legal obligation dictated by the Native Vegetation Protection Law (Law 12.651/2012), which drives and enforces how, where and how much native vegetation should be conserved, managed, or restored within farms [@mello_achieving_2021; @mello_integrating_2021]. All rural properties within the Atlantic Forest must have a minimum of 20% of the area set aside as natural vegetation. This is composed of Areas of Permanent Protection (APP), whose location is defined by the legislation (environmentally sensitive areas, such as riparian areas, hilltops, and steep slopes) and Legal Reserves allocated by landowners to achieve the minimum set-aside target of 20%. Farmers who do not have the mandatory area covered with natural vegetation must restore it within 20 years, or in the case of Legal Reserves, opt for a compensation scheme outside their property – e.g. trading with landowners with Legal Reserves surplus [@mello_achieving_2021; @mello_integrating_2021]. The spatial information concerning farm boundaries and set-aside areas is uploaded to an environmental rural register platform named CAR (Portuguese acronym), a public access database.

To analyze the cost-benefit relationship incurred by restoration actions, we designed 8 scenarios with a time window of 20 years, based on the Native Vegetation Protection Law, and more ambitious commitments (Methods). Our **baseline scenario** represents the 2017 land-use and land-cover situation. In four additional scenarios, we set forest cover targets at the farm-level, ranging from 10-40% with 10% increment, including targets above the 20% required by the law (**farm-level restoration scenarios**). Finally, to test the performance of designating restorations at a regional instead of farm-scale, we simulated three **regional-level restoration scenarios** where we combined the area of all focal farms and set three targets (20, 30, and 40%) so that the combined farms-area would have achieved the defined target at the regional scale. This regional approach favors restoration within farms with lower restoration costs in the region, while high-cost farms compensate for their forest deficit. For the farm and regional level scenarios, we used a prioritization algorithm [@hanson_prioritizr_2020] that applies linear programming to find optimal solutions to achieve the targets, whilst minimizing restoration costs incurred by farmers. 

The scenarios were applied to 507 farms from 58 municipalities selected in one of the most traditional areas for coffee production in the country (Figure \@ref(fig:studysite)), responsible for 22% of the national production and ~7% of the global production (2019 data from the International Coffee Organization and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics-IBGE). This region is within the Atlantic Rainforest biome, recognized as one of the world's largest biodiversity hotspots. Our focused farms ranged from 7-2,000 ha in size (mean= 233 ha).

We estimated the immediate cost of allocating areas for restoration as a sum of restoration costs and the opportunity cost of foregone production (Supplementary Figure B1), hereafter named total restoration costs. Restoration costs for the 20 years were estimated using a 30 m resolution raster containing the probability of natural regeneration or the necessity of actively planting seedlings [@crouzeilles_achieving_2019] and costs with restoration from projects within the Atlantic Rainforest [@brancalion_what_2019] (Methods). The forgone production was calculated as a combination of the net present value over 20 years of the main crops grown in the region and the spatial distribution of crops and pasture (see Methods for details). We also explored consequences of restoration scenarios on coffee production, accounting for changes in area under production and changes in coffee yield, which we parameterized using a  coffee-yield model relating landscape metrics to coffee productivity (Methods). This model, allowed us to realistically forecast restoration-derived changes in yield outcomes.

We also considered compensation payments, based on the Native Vegetation Protection Law, which established a market for Legal Reserves (Methods). Total restoration costs, opportunity cost based on our yield model, and compensation payments were combined and will hereafter be referred to as total intervention costs. For carbon sequestration calculation, we used literature data to estimate aboveground [@poorter_biomass_2016] and belowground [@zanini_effect_2021] carbon sequestered over 20 years in each scenario (Methods). 

## Results

Opportunity cost and restoration cost increased substantially with the proportion of area targeted for restoration (Figure \@ref(fig:painel) a and b; Supplementary Figure B2a and B2b), mostly due to the increasing coffee area converted to forest (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)c; Supplementary Figure B2c). Most scenarios had a marginal increase in yield in comparison with the baseline scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)d; Supplementary Figure B2d). However, for scenarios with restoration targets >20%, yield increases did not increase total production enough (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)e; Supplementary Figure B2e) to compensate for the replacement of coffee-planted areas with forest. Scenarios rl30 and rl40 had an unexpected average decrease in yield.  Those later scenarios resulted in concentrated forest patches, favoring situations of high forest cover (>50%) and very low coffee cover (<10%) (Supplementary Figure B3), even though the average distance from the nearest forest did not vary significantly among scenarios (Supplementary Figure B4). Farms in a similar situation used to build our predictive yield model had lower yield (Supplementary Figure B5), which can be a consequence of a lower productivity potential where they are located (see Supplementary Material), as described previously in the Atlantic Forest region [@gonzalez-chaves_positive_2021].

There were three scenarios for which we did not find reductions in production after 20 years and where coffee yield showed a slight increase (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)e; Supplementary Figure B2e): fl10, fl20, and rl20. Under these scenarios, restoration actions were more advantageous economically, and the relationship between costs and benefits was more balanced (Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). In addition to the changes in production, we also computed forest compensation costs and gains – when farmers trade their Legal Reserve surplus and deficit to achieve legal compliance (Figure \@ref(fig:painel)f-g; Supplementary Figure B2f-g). However, compensation schemes represented a small fraction of the cash flow associated with the interventions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)), which were predominantly a result of changes in production, suggesting that losing coffee areas was the main financial challenge posed by restoration in the region.


```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Proportional of the cash flow represented by the intervention costs.

The overall financial balance for all scenarios was negative. For example, achieving legal compliance enforcing farm-level forest cover (fl20) without offsite compensation would imply an average cost of USD 63,719 per farm, or around USD 32 million in total to add ~ 12 thousand ha of forest above the baseline (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)a). However, when we considered the farm’s forest cover at the baseline, we found that for farms that already had at least 10% forest cover, yield increase outweighed total intervention costs for some scenarios. As a result, there was an average increase of up to a 1.7% in net income in comparison with the baseline scenario for scenarios fl10 ,fl20, and rl20 (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)b; Supplementary Figure B6). For farms with forest cover below 10%, total intervention costs outweighed potential benefits with yield increase (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)c). These results suggest that for our study region, compliance with the Native Vegetation Protection Law would have net financial gains for farms with > 10% of forest cover. However, farms with <10% forest cover and scenarios with more ambitious restoration targets (>20%) had 3 to 16.6% decrease in farm income, reflecting the negative net change in production and the high restoration costs.
